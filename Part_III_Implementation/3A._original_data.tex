In this appendix, some original implementation data which is thought
redundant to put in the main context are put here. These details may
contributes to further researches and gives a global image of the
parameter and version sensibility of code MDFT.

\section{Series of charged $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{H}_{4}$ center}

These tests are done with the sequential code.
