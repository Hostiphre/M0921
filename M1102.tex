\include{Introduction}

\ctparttext{This chapter gives a brief review of all the basic concepts and previous
work that this thesis is based on.\\
\medskip{}
In section \ref{chpt:models}, we begin by introducing the frequent
models of solvent in a simulation, from the simplest implicit continuum
model to the most complex explicit one. The overview of these models
then helps to understand the choice of description scale used in our
study, as well as its limits.\\
\medskip{}
Once the model is chosen, all the theories become mathematical problems.
Section \ref{chpt:statistical-mechanics} reviews some basic concepts
of statistical mechanics for liquids (theory of liquids), which present
some brief formalisms deduced for an atomic solvent model. Two frontier
approaches are then introduced with a few deductions: the molecular
density functional theory (\acs{MDFT}) that this thesis works upon,
and the integral equation theory (\acs{IET}). A mathematical equivalence
between these two theories is also presented, which gave us later
the idea to use the expansion technics in \acs{IET} to serve \acs{MDFT}.
The following section \ref{chpt:iem-mdft} gives the extension of
these theory to molecular solvent case.\\
\medskip{}
Section \ref{chpt:mdft} gives a detailed presentation of the initial
code \acs{MDFT}, which the development in this thesis is based on.}

\ctparttext{This chapter presents a complete theory of the $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{exc}}$
evaluation under HRF approximation: 
\[
\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{exc}}=-\frac{\beta^{-1}}{2}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r_{1}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r_{2}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega_{1}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega_{2}}\Delta\rho(\mathbf{r_{1}},\mathbf{\Omega_{1}})\Delta\rho(\mathbf{r_{2}},\mathbf{\Omega_{2}})c(r_{12},\mathbf{\Omega_{1}},\mathbf{\Omega_{2}})
\]
which is based on previous work of Zhao et al. \citep{Zhao_2011},
where the HRF approximation bas been applied to linear molecules ($\mathbf{\Omega}\equiv(\Theta,\Phi)$).
In this thesis, the method is generated to molecular solvent, using
3 Euler angles, i. e. $\mathbf{\Omega}\equiv(\Theta,\Phi,\Psi)$,
where the computing cost of the original algorithm is no longer reasonable.
Further approximation is therefore made, where the density variable
$\rho(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega})$ is expended on generalized spherical
harmonics. Theoretically, this approximation gives little loss of
accuracy, but makes a great advantage in computing time and memory
requirement. The prove is shown in the implementation part.\\
\medskip{}
Section \ref{chpt:fft-spatial} describes the FFT treatment for the
spatial convolution in the gradient $\gamma$ of the excess functional
$\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{exc}}$, which reduces the algorithm complexity
from $O(N^{2})$ to $O(N\log_{2}N)$. A DCF directly issue of Monte
Carlo simulation and solution HNC is used, in both intermolecular
and projection form. To use the intermolecular form, the matrix which
does the transform from laboratory to intermolecular coordinates system
is generalized to molecular case compared to previous work, then interpolation
of zero and first order is involved. To use the projection from, DCF
is reconstructed with all projections. For order of projections $n_{\mathrm{max}}=1$,
the formula of each projections are written explicitly. \\
\medskip{}
Section \ref{chpt:angular-convolution} presents the treatment of
angular convolution. As IEM and MDFT have mathematical equivalence,
an algorithm inspired by the work of Fries \citep{Fries_Patey_1985}
and Blum \citep{Blum_I,Blum_II} for IEM is built for MDFT. In this
algorithm, the density variable $\rho(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega})$
is expended on generalized spherical harmonics, then rotated onto
intermolecular frame. It is shown that in this form, the OZ equation
is largely simplified.\\
\medskip{}
The solvent properties involved in this thesis are presented in the
next two chapters. Section \ref{chpt:thermodynamic-quantities} presents
some thermodynamic quantities, including the solvation free energy
and its corrections, ... and section \ref{chpt:solvation-structure}
gives some forms of structure that can be preformed, such as the radical
distribution function, radical polarization functions, rotational
invariants expansion, etc.}

\ctparttext{The code MDFT developed in this thesis is based on the branch master
of Git project MDFT (\url{https://github.com/maxlevesque/MDFT/}),
version {[}Fri Jun 20 19:05:52 2014 +0200{]}. All the implementations
are run on \textsf{\textbf{POINCARE}} machines of IDRIS, which involved
two kinds of machines:\\
\medskip{}
\textsf{\textbf{poincare{[}001-092{]}:}} 2 processors Sandy Bridge
E5-2670 (2.60GHz, 8 cores per processor, being 16 cores per node);
32 GB of memory per node.\\
\medskip{}
\textsf{\textbf{poincarebig{[}01-02{]}:}} 4 processors AMD Opteron
6282 (2.60GHz, 16 cores per processor, being 64 cores per node); 128
GB of memory per node.\\
\medskip{}
The former is used for regular calculation, whose memory hierarchy
is shown in figure \ref{fig:poincare}. The later is only used in
the evaluation of accuracy, in case of memory leak in the former.\\

Section \ref{chpt:algorithms-and-branches}, gives a brief introduction

\medskip{}
Section \ref{chpt:seq-code-performance} computing performance and
memory limits for the sequential code. Due to the time limit, the
parallelized version has not been totally built, it is put in the
