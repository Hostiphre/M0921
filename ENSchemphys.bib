	abstract = {It has been generally assumed that in the transition elements (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) the 3d shell is filled with ten electrons or is nearly filled, and that the d electrons make no significant contribution to the cohesive forces in metals. Evidence is presented here to show that about half of the d orbitals (2.56 of the total of 5) are involved in bond formation, through hybridization with the 4s and 4p orbitals, and that the number of covalent bonds resonating among the available interatomic positions increases from one to nearly six in the sequence K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, remains nearly constant from Cr to Ni, and begins to decrease with Cu. The remaining 2.44 d orbitals, with very small interatomic overlapping, are occupied by nonbonding electrons which are mainly responsible for the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic properties of the metals. This point of view provides a qualitative explanation of many properties of the transition metals (including those of the palladium and platinum groups), such as interatomic distance, characteristic, temperature, hardness, compressibility, and coefficient of thermal expansion, and it accounts satisfactorily for the observed values of the atomic saturation magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic elements iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. It is also shown to provide a reason for the occurrence of the positive exchange integrals which give rise to ferromagnetism.},

These ultrasound, Brillouin and depolarized light scattering, and transient grating experiments show that, above 215 K, this solution behaves like supercooled water: its zero frequency sound velocity C(0) continuously decreases with decreasing temperature, and the reorientational dynamics of the water molecules can be directly detected at some temperatures of this domain. Conversely, below 215 K, a new regime sets in, where the apparent C(0) is practically temperature independent and where a β, Arrenhius like, relaxation process coexists with the usual, Vogel-Fulcher like, α relaxation process of the supercooled liquid. These results are similar to those recently obtained in LiCl, 6H(2)O. The onset of the new regime is possibly due to an increase of the interaction of the water molecules with a neighboring Li(+) ion when lowering the temperature. We also compare our results with published dielectric data on water solutions of glass forming polyalcohols. Some of them present a low temperature splitting of their relaxation time similar to what is found in LiBr, 6H(2)O.},

	abstract = {The term hydrophobic interactions denotes the tendency of relatively apolar molecules to stick together in aqueous solution. These interactions are of importance in many chemical disciplines, including the chemistry of in vivo processes. Enzyme-substrate interactions, the assembly of lipids in biomembranes, surfactant aggregation, and kinetic solvent effects in water-rich solutions are all predominantly governed by hydrophobic interactions. Despite extensive research efforts, the hydration of apolar molecules and the noncovalent interactions between these molecules in water are still poorly understood. In fact, the question as to what the driving force for hydrophobic intractions is shifts the study into a quest for a detailed understanding of the remarkable properties of liquid water. This review highlights some of the novel insights that have been obtained in the past decade. The emphasis is on both hydrophobic hydration and hydrophobic interactions since both phenomena are intimately connected. Several traditional views have been found to be deeply unsatisfactory, and courageous attempts have been made to conceptualize the driving force behind pairwise and bulk hydrophobic interactions. The review presents an admittedly personal selection of the recent experimental and theoretical developments, and when necessary, reference is made to relevant studies of earlier date.},

Two proteins were studied, in water-trehalose matrices: a water-soluble protein (carboxy derivative of horse heart myoglobin) and a membrane protein (reaction centre from Rhodobacter sphaeroides). Several experimental techniques were used: Mossbauer spectroscopy, elastic neutron scattering, FTIR spectroscopy, CO recombination after flash photolysis in carboxy-myoglobin, kinetic optical absorption spectroscopy following pulsed and continuous photoexcitation in Q(B) containing or Q(B) deprived reaction centre from R. sphaeroides. Experimental results, together with the outcome of molecular dynamics simulations, concurred to give a picture of how water-containing matrices control the internal dynamics of the embedded proteins. This occurs, in particular, via the formation of hydrogen bond networks that anchor the protein surface to the surrounding matrix, whose stiffness increases by lowering the sample water content. In the conclusion section, we also briefly speculate on how the protein-matrix interactions observed in our samples may shed light on the protein-solvent coupling also in liquid aqueous solutions.},

In particular we have calculated the magnetic moments on the Fe and Cr(Mn) sites and the saturation magnetization of alloys. The moments coupling is a function of the alloy concentration and for iron-rich alloys this coupling changes from parallel (ferromagnetic) to antiparallel (antiferromagnetic). In our calculations both alloys have almost linear dependence of saturation magnetization as a function of concentration in a good agreement with the so-called Slater-Pauling curve. The deviations from this linear function in the bcc Mn1-xFex alloy (stable phase at low concentration of Mn and epitaxial phase at high concentrations) are explained by the presence of two-phase regions due to first-order transitions into nonferromagnetic phases.},

Care has first been taken to explore thoroughly the simulation conditions to obtain reliable results free from artificial influences. Grafting an intramolecular potential on top of an originally rigid model introduces minor changes in the structure of the liquid at room temperatures. Dynamic properties are sensitive to the choice of intramolecular potential, but a general trend is that flexibility slows down the molecular motion. For flexible water the dynamic retardation is caused by the increase of the dipole moment, which increases the energetic coupling to the surrounding liquid, and by the intramolecular distortion, giving rise to a larger radius of gyration compared with the equilibrium monomer value. Experimental vibrational frequencies are not accurately reproduced with either the harmonic or anharmonic intramolecular potential studied. In contrast, for a nonpolar system of propane the structural and dynamic properties of the liquid remain the same whether bonds are rigid or flexible.},

The continuum approach is based on the empirical potential-based quasi-continuum theory (EQT) and classical density functional theory (cDFT). EQT is a simple and fast approach to predict inhomogeneous density and potential profiles of confined fluids. We use EQT potentials to construct a grand potential functional for cDFT. The EQT-cDFT-based grand potential can be used to predict various thermodynamic properties of confined fluids. In this work, we demonstrate the EQT-cDFT approach by simulating Lennard-Jones fluids, namely, methane and argon, confined inside slit-like channels of graphene. We show that the EQT-cDFT can accurately predict the structure and thermodynamic properties, such as density profiles, adsorption, local pressure tensor, surface tension, and solvation force, of confined fluids as compared to the molecular dynamics simulation results.},

	abstract = {The spin-lattice relaxation time for nuclei possessing electric quadrupole moments is determined mainly by the electric quadrupolar interactions between the nucleus and its environment. Here we give a microscopic formulation of the nuclear quadrupolar relaxation problem for a nucleus of a monatomic solute dissolved in molecular fluids. Our formulation is based on classical statistical mechanics and the interaction site model representation of the intermolecular potential. We assume that the fluctuating field gradient felt by the nucleus is caused mainly by the charge distribution of the surrounding solvent molecules, modulated by the Sternheimer (anti)shielding factor of the nucleus. In the extreme narrowing condition, the problem reduces to the determination of a time integral of the field gradient time correlation function G(t) on the nucleus position. By separation of G(t) into a static contribution G(t = 0) and a normalized time correlation function, we seek microscopic expressions for both G(t = 0) and its correlation time τQ. Within certain approximations we express τQ in terms of the wavevector-dependent polarization charge correlation time τμ(k), and G(t = 0) in terms of the pure solvent charge structure factor Sμ(k) and an analytical function of the solute cavity radius a. Taking as input τμ(k) from molecular dynamics simulations of the pure solvent and Sμ(k) from the extended reference interaction-site model (XRISM) calculation, we apply the theory to the spin lattice relaxation rate of seven quadrupolar nuclei in acetonitrile solution. The solutes considered cover a wide range of size, charge, and nuclear spin quantum number. With reasonable choices of the solute cavity radii, the theory successfully reproduces the experimentally measured 1/T1 for these solutes. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we also investigate the effects on 1/T1 of neglecting the solute mobility. Our simulated data suggest that the solute mobility can reasonably be neglected for spin relaxation of heavy quadrupolar nuclei such as Kr and Xe. Finally, the dielectric continuum limit of our theory is discussed and compared with the related theory developed by Hynes and Wolynes. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

Here we show, from molecular dynamics, that the structure of a subset of water molecules in the first hydration layer, those preserving four nearest water neighbors, resembles that of water at ∼10 °C, and that the origin of the orientational slowdown is mainly a decrease of the hydrogen-bond (HB) acceptor switch frequency, while water structuring plays a minor role, slightly accelerating HB acceptor switches. By portraying the mean HB dynamics of water as a doubly periodic event, we demonstrate that the orientational retardation factor is effectively defined by the ratio of the HB acceptor switch period in the hydration layer and bulk. Excluded volume delays HB acceptor switches, accelerating the orientational relaxation of ∼1/3 of the water molecules on the hydration layer in this time scale, but this is largely exceeded by the decrease of the HB switch frequency, consistent with 2D IR spectroscopy experiments, and at the origin of longer HB lifetimes. The orientational mobility of water populations with long HB lifetimes is also probed, and although a relaxation plateau is observed at ∼10 ps consistent with fs IR spectroscopy experiments, no water molecule is rotationally frozen at any time scale. The proposed molecular picture is consistent with fs IR, 2D IR, and NMR experimental results on the orientational retardation of water and reveals the magnitude of "hidden" enhanced ordered water pentamers formed near hydrophobic solutes.},

Microchannels, however, are characterized by a large surface-to-volume ratio, so that surface properties strongly affect flow resistance in submicrometre devices. We present here results showing that the concerted effect of wetting properties and surface roughness may considerably reduce friction of the fluid past the boundaries. The slippage of the fluid at the channel boundaries is shown to be greatly increased by using surfaces that are patterned on the nanometre scale. This effect occurs in the regime where the surface pattern is partially dewetted, in the spirit of the 'superhydrophobic' effects that have been discovered at macroscopic scales. Our results show for the first time that, in contrast to common belief, surface friction may be reduced by surface roughness. They also open the possibility of a controlled realization of the 'nanobubbles' that have long been suspected to play a role in interfacial slippage.},

While the incommensurate SDW magnetism and the Néel temperature are well established for bulk Cr, the question arises of how these properties are altered in thin films and superlattices either due to dimensionality effects or due to proximity with the ferromagnetic or paramagnetic boundary layers. After a brief introduction to the basic properties of bulk Cr, this review provides an overview of the SDW magnetism in thin Cr films, starting with surface properties and continuing with the discussion of Cr films of various thickness. The emphasis is more on SDW order in different confined environments than on exchange coupling. The scaling of the Néel temperature with thickness, the critical thickness for the onset of SDW order, the orientation of the SDW wave vector in different environments and the enhancement of SDW order due to proximity effects are extensively discussed. Most important is the role of the interface roughness in case of contact with a ferromagnetic layer. Conflicting results obtained with different experimental techniques are critically reviewed and an interpretation of the SDW order depending on interface quality is proposed.},

We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond “wire,” the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report.},

Even within a second-order approximation for the free-energy functional, the so-called homogeneous reference fluid approximation, we show that the hydration free-energies computed for a data set of 500 organic compounds are of similar quality as those obtained from molecular dynamics free-energy perturbation simulations, with a computer cost reduced by 2?3 orders of magnitude. This requires to introduce the proper partial volume correction to transform the results from the grand canonical to the isobaric-isotherm ensemble that is pertinent to experiments. We show that this correction can be extended to 3D-RISM calculations, giving a sound theoretical justification to empirical partial molar volume corrections that have been proposed recently.},

The technique generalises what has been originally proposed by Zerah and extensively used since then with great success for various fluids and mixtures of spherical objects. At each main iteration, the linearised cycle obtained by differentiating the Ornstein–Zernike and the integral equations is itself solved iteratively in terms of Δgmnlμν(r) projections. Its solution is reached very rapidly thanks to the powerful biconjugate gradient method and to the absence of any Euler angle manipulation. The virial equation is written in a shape formally different from the standard one, which allows a much higher numerical precision for the pressure without extra numerical work. The complete scheme is illustrated on the popular SPC/E water model.},

The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, ε̇, and ζ, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables ε̇ and ζ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated.

	abstract = {This article presents an efficient and parallelized implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for quantum chemistry calculations. The DMRG method as a large-scale multireference electronic structure model is by nature particularly efficient for one-dimensionally correlated systems, while the present development is oriented toward applications for polynuclear transition metal compounds, in which the macroscopic one-dimensional structure of electron correlation is absent. A straightforward extension of the DMRG algorithm is proposed with further improvements and aggressive optimizations to allow its application with large multireference active space, which is often demanded for metal compound calculations. Special efficiency is achieved by making better use of sparsity and symmetry in the operator and wave function representations. By accomplishing computationally intensive DMRG calculations, the authors have found that a large number of renormalized basis states are required to represent high entanglement of the electron correlation for metal compound applications, and it is crucial to adopt auxiliary perturbative correction to the projected density matrix during the DMRG sweep optimization in order to attain proper convergence to the solution. Potential energy curve calculations for the Cr 2 molecule near the known equilibrium precisely predicted the full configuration interaction energies with a correlation space of 24 electrons in 30 orbitals [denoted by ( 24 e , 30 o ) ]. The energies are demonstrated to be accurate to 0.6 m E h (the error from the extrapolated best value) when as many as 10 000 renormalized basis states are employed for the left and right DMRG block representations. The relative energy curves for [ Cu 2 O 2 ] 2 + along the isomerization coordinate were obtained from DMRG and other correlated calculations, for which a fairly large orbital space ( 32 e , 62 o ) is modeled as a full correlation space. The DMRG prediction nearly overlaps with the energy curve from the coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] calculations, while the multireference complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations with the small reference configuration ( 8 e , 8 o ) are found to overestimate the biradical character of the electronic state of [ Cu 2 O 2 ] 2 + according to the one-electron density matrix analysis.},

The aim of this work is to investigate the vibrational behaviour of trehalose, maltose and sucrose/H2O mixtures with INS in order to characterize the structural changes induced by these disaccharides on the H2O hydrogen-bonded network. A higher degree of 'crystallinity' for the trehalose/H2O system is observed in the vibrational region corresponding to the ice bending modes. This feature could justify the better cryptobiotic action of trehalose compared with maltose and sucrose. On the other hand, the better bioprotective effectiveness could be explained by the higher destructuring effect of trehalose, emphasized by the analysis of the librational modes region.},

	abstract = {Although protein adsorption on solids is of immense relevance, experimental limitations mean there is still a remarkable lack of understanding of the adsorption mechanism, particularly at a molecular level. By subjecting 240+ molecular dynamics simulations of two peptide/water/solid surface systems to statistical analysis, a generalized molecular level mechanism for peptide adsorption has been identified for uncharged surfaces that interact strongly with the solution phase. This mechanism is composed of three phases: (1) biased diffusion of the peptide from the bulk phase toward the surface; (2) anchoring of the peptide to the water/solid interface via interaction of a hydrophilic group with the water adjacent to the surface or a strongly interacting hydrophobic group with the surface; and (3) lockdown of the peptide on the surface via a slow, stepwise and largely sequential adsorption of its residues, which we term ?statistical zippering?. The adsorption mechanism is dictated by the existence of water layers adjacent to the solid and orientational ordering therein. By extending the solid into the solution by ?8 Å and endowing it with a charged character, the water layers ensure the peptide feels the effect of the solid at a range well beyond the dispersion force that arises from it, thus inducing biased diffusion from afar. The charging of the interface also facilitates anchoring of the peptide near the surface via one of its hydrophilic groups, allowing it time it would otherwise not have to rearrange and lockdown. Finally, the slowness of the lockdown process is dictated by the need for the peptide groups to replace adjacent tightly bound interfacial water.},

	abstract = {Diffusive transport of particles or, more generally, small objects, is a ubiquitous feature of physical and chemical reaction systems. In configurations containing confining walls or constrictions, transport is controlled both by the fluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and the phase space available to their dynamics. Consequently, the study of transport at the macro- and nanoscales must address both Brownian motion and entropic effects. Herein we report on recent advances in the theoretical and numerical investigation of stochastic transport occurring either in microsized geometries of varying cross sections or in narrow channels wherein the diffusing particles are hindered from passing each other (single-file diffusion). For particles undergoing biased diffusion in static suspension media enclosed by confining geometries, transport exhibits intriguing features such as 1) a decrease in nonlinear mobility with increasing temperature or also 2) a broad excess peak of the effective diffusion above the free diffusion limit. These paradoxical aspects can be understood in terms of entropic contributions resulting from the restricted dynamics in phase space. If, in addition, the suspension medium is subjected to external, time-dependent forcing, rectification or segregation of the diffusing Brownian particles becomes possible. Likewise, the diffusion in very narrow, spatially modulated channels is modified via contact particle–particle interactions, which induce anomalous sub-diffusion. The effective sub-diffusion constant for a driven single file also develops a resonance-like structure as a function of the confining coupling constant.},

	abstract = {The choice of suitable materials and the assessment of long-term materials damage are key issues that need to be addressed for the safe and reliable performance of nuclear power plants. Operating conditions such as high temperatures, irradiation and a corrosive environment degrade materials properties, posing the risk of very expensive or even catastrophic plant damage. Materials scientists are faced with the scientific challenge to determine the long-term damage evolution of materials under service exposure in advanced plants. A higher confidence in life-time assessments of these materials requires an understanding of the related physical phenomena on a range of scales from the microscopic level of single defect damage effects all the way up to macroscopic effects. To overcome lengthy and expensive trial-and-error experiments, the multiscale modelling of materials behaviour is a promising tool, bringing new insights into the fundamental understanding of basic mechanisms. This paper presents the multiscale modelling methodology which is taking root internationally to address the issues of advanced structural materials for Gen IV reactors.},

	abstract = {Methanol is an amphiphilic solute whose aqueous solutions exhibit distinctive physical properties. The volume change upon mixing, for example, is negative across the entire composition range, indicating strong association. We explore the corresponding behavior of a Jagla solvent, which has been previously shown to exhibit many of the anomalous properties of water. We consider two models of an amphiphilic solute: (i) a "dimer" model, which consists of one hydrophobic hard sphere linked to a Jagla particle with a permanent bond, and (ii) a "monomer" model, which is a limiting case of the dimer, formed by concentrically overlapping a hard sphere and a Jagla particle. Using discrete molecular dynamics, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the resulting solutions. We systematically vary the set of parameters of the dimer and monomer models and find that one can readily reproduce the experimental behavior of the excess volume of the methanol-water system as a function of methanol volume fraction. We compare the pressure and temperature dependence of the excess volume and the excess enthalpy of both models with experimental data on methanol-water solutions and find qualitative agreement in most cases. We also investigate the solute effect on the temperature of maximum density and find that the effect of concentration is orders of magnitude stronger than measured experimentally.},

	abstract = {Coarse-graining a molecular model is the process of integrating over degrees of freedom to obtain a reduced representation. This process typically involves two separate but related steps, selection of the coordinates comprising the reduced system and modeling their interactions. Both the coordinate selection and the modeling procedure present challenges. Here, we focus on the former. Typically, one seeks to integrate over the fast degrees of freedom and retain the slow degrees of freedom. Failure to separate timescales results in memory. With this motivation, we introduce a heuristic measure of memory and show that it can be used to compare competing coordinate selections for a given modeling procedure. We numerically explore the utility of this heuristic for three systems of increasing complexity. The first example is a four-particle linear model, which is exactly solvable. The second example is a sixteen-particle nonlinear model; this system has interactions that are characteristic of molecular force fields but is still sufficiently simple to permit exhaustive numerical treatment. The third example is an atomic-resolution representation of a protein, the class of models most often treated by relevant coarse-graining approaches; we specifically study an actin monomer. In all three cases, we find that the heuristic suggests coordinate selections that are physically intuitive and reflect molecular structure. The memory heuristic can thus serve as an objective codification of expert knowledge and a guide to sites within a model that requires further attention.},

All of the subtleties of the experimental procedure, the needed ancillary measurements, and the recipe for tailoring the numerical codes to the real experiment and sample are described in the case of water confined in MCM41-S-15. In particular the excluded volume effects and the relevance of liquid?substrate cross-correlation terms in the neutron cross section are quantitatively discussed. The results obtained for the microscopic structure of water evidence a non-homogeneous distribution of molecules within the pore, with the presence of water?substrate hydrogen bonds, and a strong distortion of the water?water radial distribution functions with respect to those of bulk water extending at least up to three hydration layers.},

Chem. Phys. 119, 1397 (2003)]. The C–C stretching and torsion, as well as the pyramidalization and scissoring of both CH 2 groups are included in this description. The wave-packet calculations have been performed using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for a time period up to 100 fs. While a small amount of population transfer to the electronic ground state is found within this period, the overall population decay time of the V state is found to exceed the 100 fs range significantly. The autocorrelation function of the wave packet and the stationary absorptionspectrum of the V state also have been calculated. It is found that both the torsional mode as well as the C–C stretching mode contribute to the very extended vibrational structure of the absorptionspectrum, and that both modes are strongly coupled. At least on the present ab initiosurface of limited dimensionality, the speed of pyramidalization of 90° twisted ethene appears as the bottleneck for the ultrafast radiationless decay of the V state.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, minimal kinetic models, and primarily the lattice Boltzmann equation, have met with significant success in the simulation of complex hydrodynamic phenomena, ranging from slow flows in grossly irregular geometries to fully developed turbulence, to flows with dynamic phase transitions. Besides their practical value as efficient computational tools for the dynamics of complex systems, these minimal models may also represent a new conceptual paradigm in modern computational statistical mechanics: instead of proceeding bottom-up from the underlying microdynamic systems, these minimal kinetic models are built top-down starting from the macroscopic target equations. This procedure can provide dramatic advantages, provided the essential physics is not lost along the way. For dissipative systems, one essential requirement is compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. In this Colloquium, the authors present a chronological survey of the main ideas behind the lattice Boltzmann method, with special focus on the role played by the H theorem in enforcing compliance of the method with macroscopic evolutionary constraints (the second law) as well as in serving as a numerically stable computational tool for fluid flows and other dissipative systems out of equilibrium.},

The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional, namely ionic forces and the Kohn–Sham matrix, can be computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn–Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born–Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers.},

	abstract = {Trehalose solutions were investigated by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy at different water contents, ranging from an anhydrous sample to w(C) = 40\%. While the structural α-relaxation was detectable only in the low hydration and dry samples, and in a quite limited range of temperatures, two secondary processes were presented and characterized in all the solutions investigated. In particular, the fastest secondary process displayed a characteristic behavior widely observed in other small organic glass formers. It had an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, it sped up and increased the dielectric strength when adding water and finally it possessed an activation energy compatible with the breaking/formation of two hydrogen bonds. From all these indications it was plausible to attribute it to water dipole reorientation dynamics. The slower secondary process was again well described by an Arrhenius-like function, now the relaxation time at high temperature was only slightly dependent on the exact water amount but the activation energy was markedly dependent on it. The molecular origin of this process was tentatively attributed to the motion of the entire molecule involving rotation of the two monosugar rings around the glycosidic bond.},

The ellipsoid is subject to small random changes in orientation in which the rotation probabilities about its three major axes are different. This anisotropic motion yields five nuclear correlation times; isotropic motion yields only one correlation time. The results are applicable provided that the static dipolar coupling is effectively averaged to small values by the rotational motion. For nonviscous liquids, T1 = T2. When the rotation probabilities about two axes are equal, the relaxation‐time expressions simplify a great deal, but they retain the essential relaxation features of anisotropic rotational motion; the number of nuclear correlation times is reduced to three; the relaxation times for rapid motion have been calculated as a function of the ratio of the two rotation probabilities for this case. The relaxation rates in ellipsoids of revolution obeying the Stokes approximation for motion in a continuous medium have been compared to those for spheres having the same volume. The rates for very nonspherical particles are large compared to those for the spheres. An example of internal motion of the internuclear vector within the ellipsoid is calculated.},

In this way, the method is highly adaptable to molecules of complex topology. Results are shown for solubility calculations of sodium chloride in water and light alcohols at atmospheric conditions. The pseudosupercritical path integration method is used to calculate the free energy of the solid and gives results that are in good agreement with previous studies that reference the Einstein crystal. For the solution phase calculations, the self-adaptive Wang–Landau transition-matrix Monte Carlo method is used within the context of an expanded isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The method shows rapid convergence properties and the uncertainty in the calculated chemical potential was 1\% or less for all cases. The present study underpredicts the solubility limit of sodium chloride in water, suggesting a shortcoming of the molecular models. Importantly, the proper trend for the chemical potential in various solvents was captured, suggesting that relative solubilities can be computed by the method.},

NFAs contain an ultrahigh density of Y-Ti-O-enriched dispersion-strengthening nanofeatures (NFs) that, along with fine grains and high dislocation densities, provide remarkably high tensile, creep, and fatigue strength. The NFs are stable under irradiation up to 800°C and trap He in fine-scale bubbles, suppressing void swelling and fast fracture embrittlement at lower temperatures and creep rupture embrittlement at high temperatures. The current state of the development and understanding of NFAs is described, along with some significant outstanding challenges.},

Understanding mass transfer through clay nanopores is necessary in many contexts such as groundwater hydrology, petroleum and gas reservoir engineering, as well as carbon dioxide sequestration or geological disposal of radioactive waste. Grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations first allow us to determine the water content in the pores. We then analyze the structure and diffusion of confined water using equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD). Finally, nonequilibrium MD allow us to analyze the hydrodynamic behavior of the confined fluid and assess the relevance of continuum hydrodynamics to describe the flow under a pressure gradient. The Navier?Stokes equation, using the density and viscosity of the bulk fluid, provides a reasonable description of the flow provided that the pore width is larger than 3 nm and that a slip boundary condition is used. We determine a slip length of 2.1 Å at the clay surface. Although this value is small, neglecting slip in these nanopores results in large errors on the hydrodynamic flow. In the vicinity of the surface, the deviations from the prediction of the Navier?Stokes equation cannot be captured by a local viscosity determined from MD simulations.},

Results on the evolution of defect morphology in individual cascades, the global evolution of planar (clusters/loops) and three-dimensional defect agglomerates (voids) and the temperature dependence of defect accumulation in the form of loops and voids in fcc and bcc metals are compiled and compared. The comparison demonstrates that the damage accumulation in the form of clusters/loops and voids and their dependence on irradiation temperature are dramatically different in fcc and bcc metals. These differences may arise because of significant differences in the number of surviving defects (in cascades) and intracascade clustering of vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) that get established already during the thermal spike phase of cascades. The implications of these differences are discussed. It is suggested that theoretical treatments of the damage accumulation in fcc and bcc metals must explicitly include the details of intracascade clustering of vacancies and SIAs, for example, the ratio of clustered to non-clustered vacancies and SIAs.},

We analyze in detail the case of diffusion in a domain of irregular geometry in which the presence of the boundaries induces an entropy barrier when approaching the exact dynamics by a coarsening of the description. The corresponding kinetic equation, named the Fick-Jacobs equation, is obtained, and its validity is generalized through the formulation of a scaling law for the diffusion coefficient which depends on the shape of the boundaries. The method we propose can be useful to analyze the dynamics of systems at the nanoscale where the presence of entropy barriers is a common feature.},

	abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 25: 1656–1676, 2004},

This method allows for stable sampling with respect to collapse to lower energy states and requires no uncontrolled approximations. In contrast with most previous methods to extract excited state information from quantum Monte Carlo methods, this results from a modification to the underlying propagator, and does not require explicit orthogonalization, analytic continuation, transient estimators, or restriction of the Hilbert space via a trial wavefunction. Furthermore, we show that the propagator can directly yield frequency-domain correlation functions and spectral functions such as the density of states which are difficult to obtain within a traditional quantum Monte Carlo framework. We demonstrate this approach with pilot applications to the neon atom and beryllium dimer.},

The numerical performance of the theoretical method has been validated with simulation results and experimental data for the solvation free energies of halide (F−, Cl−, Br− and I−) and alkali (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) ions in water at ambient conditions.

	abstract = {First, the basis and the characteristics of the Czjzek model for the distribution of electric field gradient (EFG) tensor in disordered solids, some of which are still unnoticed, are depicted. That model results from the statistical invariance by rotation of the structure of the considered disordered solid and from the applicability of a central limit theorem to the EFG tensor. These two conditions, which are physically realistic for a wealth of disordered solids, simplify tremendously the derivation of the EFG distribution but at the cost of a complete loss of structural information about the investigated solid. Next, we describe a simple extension of it which is intended to mimic a well-defined local environment, with given values of the asymmetry parameter and of the principal component Vzz of the EFG tensor, perturbed by the disorder of more remote atoms. The effect of disorder is rendered by a Gaussian (Czjzek) noise with an adjustable weight relative to Vzz. The number of free parameters is limited to three, as compared to a sole scale factor for the Czjzek model. Its characteristics are described as a function of the given asymmetry parameter and of the strength of the noise. The aim is to lead to a practical tool which may help to retrieve, as far as possible, the information about the local environment perturbed by disorder from hyperfine measurements and notably from NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei. As an example, that extension is applied to some static NMR spectra of 71Ga in covalent glasses. Calculated static 71Ga NMR lineshapes are shown as a function of the parameters of the extended model.},

	abstract = {An approach to calculating Raman spectra of ionic materials from first principles is described; the method is applicable to molten systems which cannot be treated by summing the contributions from normal modes of vibration. The approach offers a way to validate a simulation by comparison with a Raman spectrum; for many materials under extreme conditions of temperature or pressure, Raman spectroscopy may be the only practicable experimental window on the structure at the atomic scale. The method involves the direct calculation of the time correlation functions of the polarizability fluctuations in the sample, which involves the introduction of a model for the dependence of the polarizability on the ionic coordinates. The model is parameterized by fitting a large number of values of the polarizabilities of individual ions in condensed phase environments. These are calculated, using a recently introduced ab initio method, from the response of the electron density to an applied electric field on a series of configurations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the material of interest. The results of the calculations are compared with experimental spectra on liquid and solid LiF, liquid BeF2, and LiF:BeF2 mixtures. The spectra are well reproduced by the method, particularly the isotropic components which are generally most useful for diagnosing coordination structures in experimental studies. Since the ab initio methodology has already been shown to work for oxides, the method should be applicable to melts of geophysical interest inter alia.},

The association of ions of opposite charges is described using the BIMSA, based on the Wertheim formalism. As for nonassociating electrolytes, the hydration is taken into account by introducing a cation size and permittivity that are allowed to vary with concentration. New expressions for the osmotic and activity coefficient are given that account for this variation. These equations have been applied to fit data for a variety of aqueous solutions of pure salts at 25 °C. About 80 new salts have been treated, including perchlorates, nitrates, hydroxides, and sulfates. For some solutions, good fits could be obtained up to very high concentrations, such as 25 mol kg-1 for ammonium nitrate and 34 mol kg-1 for potassium nitrite. Solutions of NaOH and nitric acid could be described to 10 mol kg-1. A description for sulfuric acid has been obtained at low concentration (below 0.1 mol kg-1). Another description has been made for high concentrations (between 6 and 28 mol kg-1) by using a chemically plausible model. In most cases the association constant is of the same order of magnitude as the literature value when available.},

Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures.

To protect the calorimeter from corrosive fluoride vapor at high temperature, an encapsulating technique developed for this purpose was used. The samples were filled in nickel containers that were sealed by laser welding and afterward used for the measurements. From the obtained results, we derived the molar heat capacity functions of the respective samples. The heat capacities of the samples, having different compositions of the same binary system, were compared with the values for ideal behavior and the excess heat capacity function was determined for the entire composition range of the liquid solution. It was found that the excess heat capacities clearly depend on the cation radius and increase in the following order: LiF?NaF {\textless} LiF?KF {\textless} LiF?RbF {\textless} LiF?CsF.},

	abstract = {The interlayer pores of swelling 2:1 clays provide an ideal 2-dimensional environment in which to study confined fluids. In this paper we discuss our understanding of the structure and dynamics of interlayer fluid species in expanded clays, based primarily on the outcome of recent molecular modelling and neutron scattering studies. Counterion solvation is compared with that measured in bulk solutions, and at a local level the cation-oxygen coordination is found to be remarkably similar in these two environments. However, for the monovalent ions the contribution to the first coordination shell from the clay surfaces increases with counterion radius. This gives rise to inner-sphere (surface) complexes in the case of potassium and caesium. In this context, the location of the negative clay surface charge (i.e. arising from octahedral or tetrahedral substitution) is also found to be of major importance. Divalent cations, such as calcium, eagerly solvate to form outer-sphere complexes. These complexes are able to pin adjacent clay layers together, and thereby prevent colloidal swelling. Confined water molecules form hydrogen bonds to each other and to the clays' surfaces. In this way their local environment relaxes to close to the bulk water structure within two molecular layers of the clay surface. Finally, we discuss the way in which the simple organic molecules methane, methanol and ethylene glycol behave in the interlayer region of hydrated clays. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering of isotopically labelled interlayer CH3OD and (CH2OD)2 in deuterated clay allows us to measure the diffusion of the CH3- and CH2-groups in both clay and liquid environments. We find that in both the one-layer methanol solvates and the two-layer glycol solvates the diffusion of the most mobile organic molecules is close to that in the bulk solution.},

In a recent paper [M. Misin, M. V. Fedorov, and D. S. Palmer, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 091105 (2015)], those corrections were applied to solvation free energy calculations using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM). As for classical DFT,PC and PC+ improve greatly the predictions of 3D-RISM, but PC+ is described as decreasing the accuracy. In this article, we derive rigorously the expression of the pressure in 3D-RISM as well as the associated PC and PC+. This provides a consistent way to correct the solvation free-energies calculated by 3D-RISM method.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to compute the partition function (Q) for systems with enormous configurational spaces, such as fluids. Recently, we developed a Monte Carlo technique (an energy partitioning method) for computing Q [ J. Chem. Phys. 2011, 135, 174105 ]. In this paper, we use this approach to compute the partition function of a binary fluid mixture (carbon dioxide + methane); this allows us to obtain the Helmholtz free energy (F) via F = ?kBT ln Q and the Gibbs free energy (G) via G = F + pV. We then utilize G to obtain the coexisting mole fraction curves. The chemical potential of each species is also obtained. At the vapor?liquid equilibrium condition, the chemical potential of methane significantly increases, while that of carbon dioxide slightly decreases, as the pressure increases along an isotherm. Since Q is obtained from the density of states, which is independent of the temperature, equilibrium thermodynamic properties at any condition can be obtained by varying the total composition and volume of the system. Our methodology can be adapted to explore the free energies of other binary mixtures in general and of those containing CO2 in particular. Since the method gives access to the free energy and chemical potentials, it will be useful in many other applications.},

	abstract = {Liquid state theories are investigated for the local structure of the simple point charge (SPC) and a modified SPC (MSPC) model of water. The latter model includes a van der Waals repulsion between the oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms, which is necessary for the implementation of some integral equation theories. Two integral equation theories, the reference interaction site model (RISM) and the diagrammatically proper Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi (CSL) theory, are tested by comparison with simulations of the MSPC model (neither theory converges for the SPC model when the hypernetted chain closure is used). The RISM theory is in reasonable agreement with simulations, and is more accurate than the CSL theory. A density functional theory (DFT) is investigated, which treats the ideal gas functional exactly and uses a truncated expansion for the excess free energy functional. The DFT is in excellent agreement with simulations for the structure of the MSPC water model at all temperatures studied, and for the structure of the SPC water model at high temperatures. At room temperature, the DFT is in good agreement with simulations (of SPC water) for gHH(r) and gOH(r), but misses the location of the second peak in gOO(r). We attribute this deficiency to the importance of three-body correlations that are not properly incorporated in the theory. © 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Fluids adsorbed near surfaces, near macromolecules, and in porous materials are inhomogeneous, exhibiting spatially varying density distributions. This inhomogeneity in the fluid plays an important role in controlling a wide variety of complex physical phenomena including wetting, self-assembly, corrosion, and molecular recognition. One of the key methods for studying the properties of inhomogeneous fluids in simple geometries has been density functional theory (DFT). However, there has been a conspicuous lack of calculations in complex two- and three-dimensional geometries. The computational difficulty arises from the need to perform nested integrals that are due to nonlocal terms in the free energy functional. These integral equations are expensive both in evaluation time and in memory requirements; however, the expense can be mitigated by intelligent algorithms and the use of parallel computers. This paper details our efforts to develop efficient numerical algorithms so that nolocal DFT calculations in complex geometries that require two or three dimensions can be performed. The success of this implementation will enable the study of solvation effects at heterogeneous surfaces, in zeolites, in solvated (bio)polymers, and in colloidal suspensions.},

Unfortunately, many textbook       treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition,       and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners       of dusty libraries.  For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the       method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly       decoded the mumblings of their forebears.  Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient       Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can       understand.  Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them       almost effortlessly.             The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of       Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients.  Eigenvectors       are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method,       Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients.  Other topics include       preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method.  I have taken       pains to make this article easy to read.  Sixty-two illustrations are       provided.  Dense prose is avoided.  Concepts are explained in several       different ways.  Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

We explicitly include the low-lying 3s Rydberg state which has been neglected in previous ab initio molecular dynamics studies of this process. We find that although the 3s Rydberg state lies below the optically bright ππ* state, little population gets trapped on this state. Instead, the 3s Rydberg state is largely a spectator in the photodynamics, with little effect on the quenching mechanism or excited state lifetime. We predict the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum for ethylene and point out the signature of Rydberg state involvement that should be easily observed.},

	abstract = {Liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor coexistence regions of various water models were determined by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of isotherms of density fluctuation-restricted systems and by Gibbs ensemble MC simulations. All studied water models show multiple liquid-liquid phase transitions in the supercooled region: we observe two transitions of the TIP4P, TIP5P, and SPCE models and three transitions of the ST2 model. The location of these phase transitions with respect to the liquid-vapor coexistence curve and the glass temperature is highly sensitive to the water model and its implementation. We suggest that the apparent thermodynamic singularity of real liquid water in the supercooled region at about 228 K is caused by an approach to the spinodal of the first (lowest density) liquid-liquid phase transition. The well-known density maximum of liquid water at 277 K is related to the second liquid-liquid phase transition, which is located at positive pressures with a critical point close to the maximum. A possible order parameter and the universality class of liquid-liquid phase transitions in one-component fluids are discussed.},

In nonpyramidalized geometries these two electronic states are found to undergo a potential crossing for a twisting angle of ϑ=82 °, with the Z(1A1) species being the more stable for the perpendicular D 2d conformation. The dipole moments of these states are found to increase quite rapidly with pyramidalization for the entire range of twisting angle from ϑ=75 ° to ϑ=90 °, but this effect is found to reach a definite maximum in the neighborhood of the 82 ° crossing region for the unpyramidalized species and it is argued that these two phenomena are in fact closely related to one another. The CI results are found to be strongly dependent on the choice of one‐electron basis in the significant portion of key structural regions and it is concluded that the use of natural orbitals optimized for one of the two nearly degenerate singlet states leads to excessively ionic charge distributions. Finally, the minimum‐to‐minimum energy difference (T e ) between the ground and lowest singlet excited state is calculated to be 5.83 eV, suggesting a corresponding T 0 value for this transition of 5.6–5.7 eV which is in very good agreement with McDiarmid’s recent experimental determination of this quantity.},

It was shown that when the Cr content of the b.c.c. ferritic matrix is larger than a critical threshold value ({\textasciitilde}7.2 at.\% at 325 °C), the ferrite separates under neutron irradiation into two isomorphous phases, Fe-rich ([alpha]) and Cr-rich ([alpha]'). The kinetics of phase separation are much faster than under thermal aging. The quantity of precipitated [alpha]' phase increases with the Cr content, the irradiation dose, and as the irradiation temperature is reduced. The influence of Ta and W added to the RA steels seems negligible. Cold-work pre-treatment increases slightly the coarsening of irradiation-induced precipitates in the 9Cr-1Mo (EM10) steel. In the case of the low Cr content F82H steel irradiated 2.9 dpa at 325 °C, where [alpha]' phase does not form, a small irradiation-induced SANS intensity is detected, which is probably due to point defect clusters. The [alpha]' precipitates contribute significantly to the irradiation-induced hardening of 9-12 wt\% Cr content steels.},

	abstract = {Improving the efficiency of free energy calculations is important for many biological and materials design applications, such as protein-ligand binding affinities in drug design, partitioning between immiscible liquids, and determining molecular association in soft materials. We show that for any pair potential, moderately accurate estimation of the radial distribution function for a solute molecule is sufficient to accurately estimate the statistical variance of a sampling along a free energy pathway. This allows inexpensive analytical identification of low statistical error free energy pathways. We employ a variety of methods to estimate the radial distribution function (RDF) and find that the computationally cheap two-body “dilute gas” limit performs as well or better than 3D–RISM theory and other approximations for identifying low variance free energy pathways. With a RDF estimate in hand, we can search for pairwise interaction potentials that produce low variance. We give an example of a search minimizing statistical variance of solvation free energy over the entire parameter space of a generalized “soft core” potential. The free energy pathway arising from this optimization procedure has lower curvature in the variance and reduces the total variance by at least 50\% compared to the traditional soft core solvation pathway. We also demonstrate that this optimized pathway allows free energies to be estimated with fewer intermediate states due to its low curvature. This free energy variance optimization technique is generalizable to solvation in any homogeneous fluid and for any type of pairwise potential and can be performed in minutes to hours, depending on the method used to estimate g(r).},

We present a quantitative model connecting hydrogen-bond exchange dynamics to local structural fluctuations, measured by the asphericity of Voronoi cells associated with each water molecule. For a fixed local structure the regular Arrhenius behavior is recovered, and the global anomalous temperature dependence is demonstrated to essentially result from a continuous shift in the unimodal structure distribution upon cooling. The non-Arrhenius behavior can thus be explained without invoking an equilibrium between distinct structures. In addition, the large width of the homogeneous structural distribution is shown to cause a growing dynamical heterogeneity and a non-exponential relaxation at low temperature.},

In particular, its excellent 'price/performance' ratio has stimulated an ever-growing number of DFT applications in almost all fields of chemistry. However, many use DFT programs as black-box tools without having a quantum theoretical background or a concise knowledge about the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This text is designed to bridge that gap and to guide the non-expert user through the minefield arising from an uncritical use of DFT methods. "Chemists familiar with conventional quantum mechanics will applaud and benefit greatly from this particulary instructive, thorough and clearly written exposition of density functional theory: its basis, concepts, terms, implementation, and performance in diverse applications. Users of DFT for structure, energy, and molecular property computations, as well as reaction mechanism studies, are guided to the optimum choices of the most effective methods. Well done!"

Two types of pores, with diameters intermediate between 20 Å and 37.5 Å, were investigated: The first one corresponded to hydrophobic cavities, in which the prevailing wall-solution interactions were of the Lennard-Jones type. In addition, we also examined the behavior of solutions trapped within hydrophilic cavities, in which a set of unsaturated O-sites at the wall were transformed in polar silanol Si–OH groups. In all cases, the overall concentrations of the trapped electrolytes exhibited important reductions that, in the case of the narrowest pores, attained 50\% of the bulk value. Local concentrations within the pores also showed important fluctuations. In hydrophobic cavities, the close vicinity of the pore wall was coated exclusively by the solvent, whereas in hydrophilic pores, selective adsorption of Na+ ions was also observed. Mass and charge transport were also investigated. Individual diffusion coefficients did not present large modifications from what is perceived in the bulk; contrasting, the electrical conductivity exhibited important reductions. The qualitative differences are rationalized in terms of simple geometrical considerations.},

With the use of three atomistic simulation methods, we investigated defect-grain boundary interaction mechanisms in copper from picosecond to microsecond time scales. We found that grain boundaries have a surprising "loading-unloading" effect. Upon irradiation, interstitials are loaded into the boundary, which then acts as a source, emitting interstitials to annihilate vacancies in the bulk. This unexpected recombination mechanism has a much lower energy barrier than conventional vacancy diffusion and is efficient for annihilating immobile vacancies in the nearby bulk, resulting in self-healing of the radiation-induced damage.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental observations of the onset of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineralization suggest the emergence of a population of clusters that are stable rather than unstable as predicted by classical nucleation theory. This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to probe the structure, dynamics, and energetics of hydrated CaCO3 clusters and lattice gas simulations to explore the behavior of cluster populations before nucleation. Our results predict formation of a dense liquid phase through liquid-liquid separation within the concentration range in which clusters are observed. Coalescence and solidification of nanoscale droplets results in formation of a solid phase, the structure of which is consistent with amorphous CaCO3. The presence of a liquid-liquid binodal enables a diverse set of experimental observations to be reconciled within the context of established phase-separation mechanisms.
Making Crystals
The initial transition from a disordered solution to the formation of nuclei that grow into crystals continues to be a puzzle. Recent experiments suggested the formation of stable ordered clusters that appear prior to the formation of the first nuclei. Wallace et al. (p. 885; see the Perspective by Myerson and Trout) used molecular dynamics to look at the potential structure and dynamics of these clusters and lattice gas simulations to explore the population dynamics of the cluster populations prior to nucleation. A liquid-liquid phase separation process was observed whereby one phase becomes more concentrated in ions and becomes the precursor for nuclei to form.},

	abstract = {We modify the site–site as well as three-dimensional (3D) versions of the reference interaction site model (RISM) integral equations with the hypernetted chain (HNC) closures by adding a repulsive bridge correction (RBC). The RBC treats the overestimation of water ordering around a hydrophobic solute in the RISM/HNC approximation, and thus refines the entropic component in the hydration free energy. We build up the bridge functions on r−12 repulsive core potentials, and propose RBC expressions for both the site–site and 3D-RISM approaches. To provide fast calculation, we obtain the excess chemical potential of hydration by using the thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT). The site–site RISM/HNC+RBC as well as 3D-RISM/HNC+RBC approaches are applied to calculate the structure and thermodynamics of hydration of rare gases and alkanes in ambient water. For both approaches, the RBC drastically improves the agreement of the hydration chemical potential with simulation data and provides its correct dependence on the solute size. For solutes of a nonspherical form, the 3D treatment yields the hydration structure in detail and better fits simulation results, whereas the site–site approach is essentially faster. The TPT approximation gives the hydration thermodynamics in good qualitative agreement with the exact results of the thermodynamic integration, and substantially reduces computational burden. The RBC–TPT approximation can improve the predictive capability of the hybrid algorithm of a generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo simulation combined with the site–site RISM theory, used to describe protein folding with due account for the water effect at the microscopic level. The RBC can be optimized for better fit to reference simulation data, and can be generalized for solute molecules with charged groups. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {In Azotobacter vinelandii MoFe protein the oxidation of the P clusters to the S= 7/2 state is associated with a redox reaction with Em,7.5=+90 ± 10 mV (vs the normal hydrogen electrode), n= 1. A concomitant redox process is observed for a rhombic S= 1/2 EPR signal with g= 1.97, 1.88 and 1.68. This indicates that both S= 1/2 and S= 7/2 signals are associated with oxidized P clusters occurring as a physical mixture of spin states. The maximal intensity of the S= 1/2 and S= 7/2 signals in the mediated equilibrium redox titration is similar if not identical to that of solid-thionine-treated samples. Summation of the spin concentration of the S= 1/2 spin state (0.25 ± 0.03 spin/α2β2) and the S= 7/2 spin state (1.3 ± 0.2 spin/α2β2) confirms that the MoFe protein has absolutely no more than two P clusters. In spectra of enzyme fixed at potentials around −100 mV a very low-intensity g= 12 EPR signal was discovered. In parallel-mode EPR the signal sharpened and increased {\textgreater} 10-fold in intensity which allowed us to assign the g= 12 signal to a non-Kramers system (presumably S= 3). In contrast with the non-Kramers EPR signals of various metalloproteins and inorganic compounds, the sharp absorption-shaped g= 12 signal is not significantly broadened into zero field, implying that the zero field splitting of the non-Kramers doublet is smaller than the X-band microwave quantum. The temperature dependence of this g= 12 EPR signal indicates that it is from an excited state within the integer spin multiplet. A bell-shaped titration curve with Em,7.5=−307 ± 30 mV and +81 ± 30 mV midpoint potentials is found for the g= 12 EPR signal. We propose that this signal represents an intermediate redox state of the P clusters between the diamagnetic, dithionite-reduced and the fully oxidized S= 7/2 and S= 1/2 state. Redox transitions of two electrons (−307 ± 30 mV) and one electron (+90 ± 10 mV) link the sequence S= 0 ⇌S= 3 ⇌ (S = 7/2 and S= 1/2). We propose to name the latter paramagnetic oxidation states of the P clusters in nitrogenase POX1 and POX2, and to retain PN for the diamagnetic native redox state. The magnetic circular dichroism and Mössbauer data on thionine-oxidized MoFe protein have to be re-evaluated bearing in mind that the oxidized P clusters can exist in two redox-states. Finally, an account is given of the EPR spectroscopic properties of S= 9/2 and other systems obtained upon superoxidation of the MoFe protein.},

	abstract = {This paper describes Ludwig, a versatile code for the simulation of Lattice-Boltzmann
(LB) models in 3-D on cubic lattices. In fact Ludwig is not a single code, but a set
of codes that share certain common routines, such as I/O and communications. If
Ludwig is used as intended, a variety of complex fluid models with different equi-
librium free energies are simple to code, so that the user may concentrate on the
physics of the problem, rather than on parallel computing issues. Thus far, Ludwig’s
main application has been to symmetric binary fluid mixtures. We first explain the
philosophy and structure of Ludwig which is argued to be a very effective way of
developing large codes for academic consortia. Next we elaborate on some parallel
implementation issues such as parallel I/O, and the use of MPI to achieve full porta-
bility and good efficiency on both MPP and SMP systems. Finally, we describe how
to implement generic solid boundaries, and look in detail at the particular case of a
symmetric binary fluid mixture near a solid wall. We present a novel scheme for the
thermodynamically consistent simulation of wetting phenomena, in the presence of
static and moving solid boundaries, and check its performance.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable advances in computing power, atomistic simulations under nonperiodic boundary conditions, with Coulombic electrostatic interactions and in systems large enough to reduce finite-size associated errors in thermodynamic quantities to within the thermal energy, are still not affordable. As a result, periodic boundary conditions, systems of microscopic size and effective electrostatic interaction functions are frequently resorted to. Ensuing artifacts in thermodynamic quantities are nowadays routinely corrected a posteriori, but the underlying configurational sampling still descends from spurious forces. The present study addresses this problem through the introduction of on-the-fly corrections to the physical forces during an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Two different approaches are suggested, where the force corrections are derived from special potential energy terms. In the first approach, the solvent-generated electrostatic potential sampled at a given atom site is restrained to a target value involving corrections for electrostatic artifacts. In the second approach, the long-range regime of the solvent polarization around a given atom site is restrained to the Born polarization, i.e., the solvent polarization corresponding to the ideal situation of a macroscopic system under nonperiodic boundary conditions and governed by Coulombic electrostatic interactions. The restraints are applied to the explicit-water simulation of a hydrated sodium ion, and the effect of the restraints on the structural and energetic properties of the solvent is illustrated. Furthermore, by means of the calculation of the charging free energy of a hydrated sodium ion, it is shown how the electrostatic potential restraint translates into the on-the-fly consideration of the corresponding free-energy correction terms. It is discussed how the restraints can be generalized to situations involving several solute particles. Although the present study considers a very simple system only, it is an important step toward the on-the-fly elimination of finite-size and approximate-electrostatic artifacts during atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for identifying accurate reaction coordinates among a set of trial coordinates. The method applies to special cases where motion along the reaction coordinate follows a one-dimensional Smoluchowski equation. In these cases the reaction coordinate can predict its own short-time dynamical evolution, i.e., the dynamics projected from multiple dimensions onto the reaction coordinate depend only on the reaction coordinate itself. To test whether this property holds, we project an ensemble of short trajectory swarms onto trial coordinates and compare projections of individual swarms to projections of the ensemble of swarms. The comparison, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, is numerically performed for each isosurface of each trial coordinate. The ensemble of short dynamical trajectories is generated only once by sampling along an initial order parameter. The initial order parameter should separate the reactants and products with a free energy barrier, and distributions on isosurfaces of the initial parameter should be unimodal. The method is illustrated for three model free energy landscapes with anisotropic diffusion. Where exact coordinates can be obtained from Kramers-Langer-Berezhkovskii-Szabo theory, results from the new method agree with the exact results. We also examine characteristics of systems where the proposed method fails. We show how dynamical self-consistency is related (through the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation) to the earlier isocommittor criterion, which is based on longer paths.},

The ion mobilities show the same trends as the experimental results with distinct maxima for cations and anions. The mobilities (defined by ui = Di/kT) of the corresponding uncharged species are also determined by simulation and are in qualitative agreement with Stokes' law. The mobilities of Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and F- increase on discharge, whereas Cl, Br, and I have smaller mobilities than the corresponding anions. The mobility of the fictitious I+ ion, which differs from I- only in its charge, lies between that of I- and I in the order uI {\textless} uI+ {\textless} uI?. The residence time of water in the first solvation shell of small cations (Li+ and Na+) and Ca2+ decreases when the ions are discharged, while the opposite is observed on neutralizing I-, suggesting the formation of a solvent cage around the large uncharged I which partially breaks up on charging, increasing the mobility of the corresponding ion. The cage breakup is greater for I- than for I+ which correlates with the asymmetry in the entropies of solvation of I- and I+, in SPC/E water on charge reversal, providing an explanation for the trends in the mobilities of I, I-, and I+. The residence times of water in the primary hydration shell around cations pass through a minimum as a function of size that correlates with the maximum in the corresponding solvation entropy, suggesting different types of hydration, i.e., electrostatic ion solvation (hydrophilic) and cage formation (hydrophobic) respectively for small and large cations. The results are in accord with recent calculations of the solvation entropy and free energy as continuous functions of the charge and size (Lynden-Bell, R. M.; Rasaiah, J. C. J. Chem. Phys. 1997, 107, 1981). Hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvation are reflected in the exchange dynamics of the water in the hydration shells around charged and uncharged solutes. The solvation dynamics of individual cations and anions are distinct at short times but characterized by the solvent at long times. Solvent dynamics, structure, and caging modulated by the charge and size of the ions are strongly implicated in determining their mobilities.},

Simulation results for the thermal conductivity, and also other transport coefficients, for the melts are compared with experimental data and with results obtained with other interaction potentials. The agreement with experiment is almost quantitative, especially for NaCl and KCl, indicating that these methodologies, perhaps with more sophisticated forms for the potential, can be used to predict thermal conductivities for melts for which experimental determination is very difficult. It is demonstrated that the polarization effects have an important effect on the energy current and are crucial to a predictive scheme for the thermal conductivity.},

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Dispersion (NMRD) provides a powerful and a noninvasive experimental technique to probe the long-term dynamics of these confined systems. However, the first step is to analyze and understand the slow dynamics of water inside these micro-reactors without any guest molecule. This is the aim of this presentation. Experimental results have been obtained for deuteron 2H NMRD of water confined in reverse micelles of bis (2-ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT) dispersed in isooctane C8H18. The water content is expressed as the molar ratio W0 = [Water]/[AOT]. The radius of the spherical reversed micelles, Rm, increases almost linearly with W0. In our case, W0 is chosen in the range 20 ≤ W0 ≤ 50 (35 ≤ Rm ≤ 80 Å). The frequency dependence for the spin-lattice relaxation rate R1(ω) exhibits two regimes, for all W0 values: a plateau at low frequency, proportional to 1/Rm, followed by the beginning of an algebraic decay. These experimental observations are discussed and compared to a numerical simulation of the intermittent Brownian diffusion of a water molecule inside a rotating reverse micelle. The possibility to probe some properties of the confinement, such as the localisation time on the sulfonated palisade and/or the water self-diffusion inside the water pool is emphasised.},

	abstract = {The (salen)Mn(III)-catalyzed epoxidation reaction mechanism has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). There is considerable interest in and controversy over the mechanism of this reaction. The results of experimental studies have offered some support for three different reaction mechanisms:? concerted, stepwise radical, and metallooxetane mediated. In this paper, a theoretical examination of the reaction suggests a novel mechanism that describes the reaction as a multichannel process combining both concerted and stepwise radical pathways. The competing channels have different spin states:? the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The singlet reaction pathway corresponds to a concerted mechanism and leads exclusively to a cis epoxide product. In contrast, the triplet and quintet reactions follow a stepwise mechanism and lead to a product mixture of cis and trans epoxides. We show that the experimentally observed dependence of isomer product ratios on electronic effects connected with the substitution of the catalyst ligands is due to changing the relative position and, hence, the relative activities of the channels with different cis?trans yields. Because the results and conclusions of the present work dramatically differ from the results and conclusion of the recent DFT theoretical investigation (Linde, C.; Akermark, B; Norrby, P.-O.; Svensson, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 5083.), we studied possible sources for the deep contradictions between the two works. The choice of the DFT functional and a model has been shown to be crucial for accurate results. Using high level ab initio calculations (coupled cluster-CCSD(T)), we show that the computational procedure employed in this study generates significantly more reliable numerical results. It is also shown that the smaller cationic model without a chlorine ligand that was used by Linde et al. is too oversimplified with respect to our larger neutral model. For this reason, using the cationic model led to a qualitatively wrong quintet reaction profile that played a key role in theoretical postulates in the earlier work.},

	abstract = {Abstract
A spatially resolved stochastic cluster dynamics (SRSCD) model is introduced to describe radiation-induced defect evolution in metals. The stochastic nature of the method allows SRSCD to model more chemical species and more mobile defects than rate theory methods without loss of computational efficiency, while reaching larger timescales and simulating larger volumes than object-oriented kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) methods. To comprehend the capabilities of the method and access new understanding of defect evolution, SRSCD is used in three scenarios. In the first, the results of Frenkel pair implantation are found to match those of rate theory in both spatially homogeneous and spatially resolved media. Next, to study spatial resolution effects and correspondence to OKMC, the results of 20 keV cascade implantation into copper is simulated and an acceptable match with OKMC is found. Finally the method is used to study the problem of helium desorption in thin iron foils. The model is compared with available experimental measures and is found to be in good agreement. The ability of SRSCD to include many mobile species of defects allows a detailed analysis of the mechanisms of helium release from the free surface of the iron foils. As a result new dominant mechanisms of helium release are discussed as well as their operating regimes.},

	abstract = {We revisit the efficient approximation of functions by sums of exponentials or Gaussians in Beylkin and Monzón (2005) [16] to discuss several new results and applications of these approximations. By using the Poisson summation to discretize integral representations of e.g., power functions r − β , β \&gt; 0 , we obtain approximations with uniform relative error on the whole real line. Our approach is applicable to a class of functions and, in particular, yields a separated representation for the function e − x y . As a result, we obtain sharper error estimates and a simpler method to derive trapezoidal-type quadratures valid on finite intervals. We also introduce a new reduction algorithm for the case where our representation has an excessive number of terms with small exponents.

As an application of these new estimates, we simplify and improve previous results on separated representations of operators with radial kernels. For any finite but arbitrary accuracy, we obtain new separated representations of solutions of Laplace's equation satisfying boundary conditions on the half-space or the sphere. These representations inherit a multiresolution structure from the Gaussian approximation leading to fast algorithms for the evaluation of the solutions. In the case of the sphere, our approach provides a foundation for a new multiresolution approach to evaluating and estimating models of gravitational potentials used for satellite orbit computations.},

	abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

The normalized ionic current blockade increases with the applied voltage and remains constant when the electrical force increases even more. We observe short and long events of current blockades. Their durations are associated, respectively, with low and high current variation. The ratio of long events increases with the electrical force. The events frequency increases exponentially as a function of applied voltage and saturates at high voltage. The dwelling time decreases exponentially at low and medium voltages when the electrical force increases. At large voltages, this time decreases inversely proportionally to the applied voltage. The long events are associated with translocation events.

Here, we use this technique to elucidate an often troublesome series of first-row diatomics consisting of Be2, C2, CN, CO, N2, NO, O2, and F2. Using i-FCIQMC, the dissociation energies of these molecules are obtained almost entirely to within chemical accuracy of experimental results. Furthermore, the i-FCIQMC calculations are performed in a relatively black-box manner, without any a priori knowledge or specification of the wave function. The size consistency of i-FCIQMC is also demonstrated with regards to these diatomics at their more multiconfigurational stretched geometries. The clear and simple i-FCIQMC wave functions obtained for these systems are then compared and investigated to demonstrate the dynamic identification of the dominant determinants contributing to significant static correlation. The appearance and nature of such determinants is shown to provide insight into both the i-FCIQMC algorithm and the diatomics themselves.},

	abstract = {The multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory is considered the standard starting point for almost all multireference approaches required for strongly correlated molecular problems. The limitation of the approach is generally given by the number of strongly correlated orbitals in the molecule, since its cost will grow exponentially with this number. We present a new multiconfigurational self-consistent field approach, wherein linear determinant coefficients of a multiconfigurational wave function are optimized via the stochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo technique at greatly reduced computational cost, with nonlinear orbital rotation parameters updated variationally based on this sampled wave function. This extends this approach to strongly correlated systems with far larger active spaces than it is possible to treat via conventional means. By comparison with this traditional approach, we demonstrate that the introduction of stochastic noise in both the determinant amplitudes and the gradient and Hessian of the orbital rotations does not preclude robust and reliable convergence of the orbital optimization. It can even improve the ability to avoid convergence to local minima in the orbital space, and therefore aid in finding variationally lower-energy solutions. We consider the effect on the convergence of the orbitals as the number of walkers and the sampling time within the active space increases, as well as the effect on the final energy and error. The scope of the new protocol is demonstrated with a study of the increasingly strongly correlated electronic structure in a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to the large coronene molecule in a complete active space of 24 π electrons in 24 orbitals, requiring only modest computational resources.},

The basic idea is to choose a combination of the current gradient and some previous search directions as a new search direction and to find a step-size by using various inexact line searches. Using more information at the current iterative step may improve the performance of the algorithm. This motivates us to find some new gradient algorithms which may be more effective than standard conjugate gradient methods. Uniformly gradient-related conception is useful and it can be used to analyze global convergence of the new algorithm. The global convergence and linear convergence rate of the new algorithm are investigated under diverse weak conditions. Numerical experiments show that the new algorithm seems to converge more stably and is superior to other similar methods in many situations.},

It is found that the interaction with the solute affects the tetrahedral network of hydrogen bonded water molecules in a manner similar to the application of high pressure to pure water. The solvation shell of the OH(-) ions has an almost concentration independent structure, although with concentration dependent coordination numbers. The hydrogen site coordinates a water molecule through a weak bond, while the oxygen site forms strong hydrogen bonds with a number of molecules that is on the average very close to four at the higher water concentrations and decreases to about three at the lowest one. The competition between hydrogen bond interaction and Coulomb forces in determining the orientation of water molecules within the cation solvation shell is visible in the behavior of the g(NaHw)(r) function},

This was performed taking into account known modification of ionic radius and atomic polarizability across the series and thus changing potential parameters according to that. Our procedure avoids the hard task of doing expensive high level ab initio calculations for all the atoms in the series and provides results in good agreement with experimental data and with ab initio calculations performed on the last atom in the series ( Lu 3 + , the atom for which the extrapolation should be in principle much crude). Thus we have studied the hydration properties of the whole Ln 3 + series by performing classical molecular dynamics in liquid phase. This systematic study allows us to rationalize from a microscopic point of view the different experimental results on Ln 3 + -water distances, first shell coordination numbers and first shell water self-exchange reactivity. In particular, we found that across the series the coordination number decreases from 9 for light lanthanoids to 8 for heavy lanthanoids in a continuous shape. This is due to the continuous changing in relative stability of the two forms that can be both populated at finite temperature with different probabilities as a function of the Ln 3 + atomic number. The changeover of the Ln 3 + ionic radius across the series resulted to be the main driving physical properties governing not always the Ln 3 + -water distance changing across the series but also the observed coordination number and consequently ligand dynamics.},

	abstract = {Mineralogical and geotechnical investigations on the possible use of compacted bentonite as a buffer material in nuclear waste repositories are reported. The swelling capacity is highly dependent on the density of the compacted bentonite. Swelling pressures {\textgreater}30 MPa were measured for dry densities of {\textasciitilde}2.0 g/cm3. Added iron or magnetite powder up to 20 wt\% had no influence on the swelling capacity. Compacted mixtures of 20 wt\% ground set cement and bentonite showed higher swelling pressures but lower swelling strain capability than compacted bentonite alone. Steam lowered the swelling pressure of compacted bentonite to {\textasciitilde}60\% of the original value. The influence was, however, reversible by ultrasonic treatment. The thermal conductivity of saturated compacted bentonite at a density of 2.0-2.1 g/cm3 is {\textasciitilde}1.35-1.45 W/m°K. The volumetric heat capacity ranges from 3.1 x 106 to 3.4 x 106 J/m3°K. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the compacted bentonite is {\textless}10-12 m2/s. The apparent diffusion coefficients for various ions in compacted bentonite for water contents in the range of 20 to 25 wt\% are: K+: 5 x 10-11, Cs+: 6 x 10-12, Sr2+: 3 x 10-11, UO2+2: {\textless}10-13, Th4+: {\textless}10-13, Fe2+: 4 x 10-11, Fe3+: 4 x 10-11, Cl-: 1 x 10-10, and I-: 1 x 10-10 m2/s. The 'breakthrough time' for an apparent diffusion coefficient of 10-11 m2/s in compacted bentonite 1 m thick was estimated to be {\textasciitilde}3000 years. The mineralogical longevity was investigated on natural K-bentonites from Kinnekulle, Sweden, and Montana, USA. Although these materials have undergone considerable changes during diagenesis and contain various amounts of mixed-layer illite-smectite, they still have a substantial swelling and adsorption capacity. The investigations demonstrate that although the properties of bentonite are negatively influenced to a certain extent by heat, hot steam, iron and cement, compacted bentonite is still the best choice to act as a buffer material in a nuclear waste repository.},

	abstract = {The Henry's law constants (HLCs) for all 209 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were predicted at 25 degrees C using the quantum mechanical (QM) continuum solvation models COSMO-SAC and SM6, and trends were examined. COSMO-SAC HLCs were also predicted for all congeners at 4, 11, 18, and 31 degrees C. The temperature dependences of the HLCs were used to calculate enthalpy of solvation (deltaHs) values. At 25 degrees C, COSMO-SAC and SM6 predicted similar values of the HLC, which are consistent with all but one of the available sets of measurements, and have smaller root-mean-square prediction errors than other models tested. This supports the validity of the QM values, and the recommendation of their use in environmental transport and fate models. Intercongener trends in the HLCs appear to be dominated by the strength of PCB-water polar interactions. The COSMO-SAC predictions between 4 and 31 degrees C indicate that the temperature dependence of the HLC is similar for all congeners. At low temperatures, the HLC predictions for several heavy congeners are substantially higher than recently reported measurements, supporting claims in the literature that these low-temperature data are inaccurate.},

The data are further analysed to yield separate oxygen-hydrogen and oxygen-oxygen partial structure factors for liquid water.

	abstract = {A multireference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) has been developed which allows the use of reference wave functions with large active spaces and arbitrary configuration selection. Internally contracted configurations are used as a basis for all configuration subspaces of the first-order wave function for which the overlap matrix depends only on the second-order density matrix of the reference function. Some other subspaces which would require the third- or fourth-order density matrices are left uncontracted. This removes bottlenecks of the complete active space second order pertubation theory (CASPT2) caused by the need to construct and diagonalize large overlap matrices. Preliminary applications of the new method for 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (DHN) and free base porphin are presented in which the effect of applying occupancy restrictions in the reference wave function (restricted active space second-order perturbation theory, RASPT2) and reference configuration selection (general MRPT2) on electronic excitation energies is tested. In the case of the S 0 –S 1 transition of DHN rapid convergence of the RASPT2 and MRPT2 excitation energies towards the CASPT2 value with increasing number of reference configurations is observed. In the calculations for the lowest five states of porphin all 24 valence π-orbitals were included in the active space of restricted active space self-consistent field (MCSCF) and MRPT2 calculations. From the RASSCF wave functions different subsets of reference configurations were selected on the basis of their coefficients. In this case convergence of the excitation energies with decreasing selection threshold is found to be rather slow, indicating the need for more elaborate selection schemes. The computed excitation energies are in good agreement with previous CASPT2 results obtained with much smaller active spaces.},

	abstract = {Benzene, dissolved in several solvents of varying viscosities and as a neat liquid, is investigated using both MD simulation techniques and NMR spectroscopy. Molecular motions—linear translation, angular rotation and reorientational motion—are studied and related to intermolecular interactions and to the microscopic solvation structure obtained from MD simulation. Self-diffusion coefficients are measured by Fourier transform pulse-gradient spin–echo NMR techniques. The reorientational rotational motion of benzene is studied using 2H NMR T1 relaxation measurements. The 2H T1 measurements also include benzene in solvents: hexane, cyclohexane, chloroform, dodecane and hexadecane. A special emphasis is on the anisotropy of benzene. Attempts are made to interpret the anisotropic behavior in terms of specific solute–solvent interactions and the solvation structure around benzene. Concerning the three solvents—water, carbon tetrachloride and carbon disulfide—a fairly clear and consistent picture emerges from both experimental and theoretical studies. The reorientational motion of benzene is found to be highly anisotropic in water, slightly less anisotropic in carbon tetrachloride, while it is nearly isotropic in carbon disulfide solution. MD simulations show some evidence for hydrogens of water approaching the ring region of benzene. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive account is given of the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of chromium (and where appropriate those of its dilute alloys) that relate to its antiferromagnetism. Neutron scattering is treated in great detail, first in the historical introduction, then as an experimental probe of both the magnetic structure and the excitations of the incommensurate spin-density-wave state and (with the assistance of x rays) of the concomitant charge-density wave and strain wave. Neutron scattering is considered as a tool to explore not only the disappearance of long-range order with increasing temperature through the growth of excitations as the weak first-order Néel transition is approached, but also the persistence of these spin fluctuations well into the paramagnetic state—processes that are still little understood. The article surveys, without mathematical details, model systems designed to reproduce the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of Cr. The energy-band structure calculations are given a more comprehensive review. Special attention is paid to calculations of the wave-vector-dependent susceptibility that reproduce the observed wave vector of the spin-density wave, and to a recent finite-temperature calculation that gives almost the right Néel temperature. The review of Fermi-surface studies emphasizes those designed to relate the spin-density wave vector (and its pressure dependence) to the nesting vector of the Fermi surface. An account is given of the spectroscopic determination of the energy gap(s), whose theoretical analysis is still unclear, and of experiments aimed at determining physical properties that throw light on the origin of the weak first-order Néel transition. The article describes the use of magnetic anomalies in the elastic moduli to determine the volume dependence of the exchange interaction responsible for antiferromagnetism in Cr. The experimental features of the spin-flip transition are reviewed, although a theory of this phenomenon is wanting. The experimental study of microscopic structure by the use of hyperfine-interaction properties is surveyed. An account is given of both experimental and theoretical studies of the surface of Cr and of Cr films and sandwiches. Finally, "technical antiferromagnetism" is discussed: the effect of severe internal strain in producing a commensurate antiferromagnetic state, wave-vector Q domains, polarization S domains (for which the experimental evidence is scanty), and ultrasonic attenuation as a tool to study them.},

In this first paper, three-dimensional reconstructions of the atomic structure of a series of thermally aged Fe-Cr alloys are shown. Two methods for computer simulation of the decomposition process are described. The first is an atomistic simulation based on the Monte Carlo algorithm and the second is a numerical solution to the Cahn--Hilliard--Cook theory. The three-dimensional atomic scale structures resulting from decomposition within the low temperature miscibility gap are reconstructed. It is shown that both models generate microstructures which are qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally.},

D. Chandler et al., Mol. Phys. 46, 1335 (1982)
]. The resulting functions are then used to diagrammatically renormalize the molecular fluid theory. A result is that the diagrammatically proper interaction site model theory is shown to be a linearized, minimal angular basis set approximation to this site-renormalized molecular theory. This framework is used to propose a new, exact, and proper closure to the diagrammatically proper interaction site model theory. The resulting equation system contains a bridge function expansion in the proper site-site theory. In addition, the construction of the theory is such that the molecular pair distribution function, in full dimensionality, is intrinsic to the theory. Furthermore, the theory is equivalent to the molecular Ornstein-Zernike treatment of site-site molecules in the basis set expansion of 
Blum and Torruella [J. Chem. Phys. 56, 303 (1971)]
. A significant formal result of the theory is the demonstration that certain classes of diagrams which would otherwise be considered improper in the interaction site model formalism are included in the angular expansion of molecular interactions. Numerical results for several apolar homonuclear models and an apolar heteronuclear model are shown to quantitatively improve upon those of reference interaction site model and our recent proper variant with respect to simulation. Significant numerical results are that the various thermodynamic quantities obey the exact symmetries and sum rules within numerical error for the different sites in the heteronuclear case, even for the low order approximation used in this work, and the theory is independent of the so-called auxiliary site problem common to previous site-site theories.},

Both approaches predict the so-called prism to be the lowest energy isomer, followed by cage, book, and cyclic isomers. The energies of the four isomers are very similar, all being within 10 – 15 meV / H 2 O . These reference data are then used to evaluate the performance of several density-functional theory exchange-correlation (xc) functionals. A subset of the xc functionals tested for smaller water clusters [I. Santra et al., J. Chem. Phys.127, 184104 (2007)] has been considered. While certain functionals do a reasonable job at predicting the absolute dissociation energies of the various isomers (coming within 10 – 20 meV / H 2 O ), none predict the correct energetic ordering of the four isomers nor does any predict the correct low total energy isomer. All xc functionals tested either predict the book or cyclic isomers to have the largest dissociation energies. A many-body decomposition of the total interactionenergies within the hexamers leads to the conclusion that the failure lies in the poor description of van der Waals (dispersion) forces in the xc functionals considered. It is shown that the addition of an empirical pairwise (attractive) C 6 R − 6 correction to certain functionals allows for an improved energetic ordering of the hexamers. The relevance of these results to density-functional simulations of liquid water is also briefly discussed.},

Furthermore, it corresponds to the composition of several candidate steels for application in nuclear technology. However, experimental evidence has been incomplete so far. The reported study by means of small-angle neutron scattering is devoted to the effect of neutron irradiation at 300°C up to fluences of 0.6 and 1.5 dpa on the microstructure of an Fe-9at\%Cr alloy. We have observed a pronounced irradiation-induced increase of scattering cross-sections for both magnetic and nuclear scattering. Bimodal size distributions of irradiation-induced defect-solute clusters have been reconstructed. The restrictions on the composition of these clusters have been discussed in terms of the scattering contrast. We have found that vacancy clusters and [alpha]'-particles alone cannot explain the full set of experimental findings.

	abstract = {The traditional electrolyte for aluminum electrolysis is composed of molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) and alumina (Al2O3). One of the objectives of the industry is to lower the operating temperature of the electrolytic process, which is currently around 960 °C. The benefits commonly evoked of a temperature decrease in the aluminum plotlines are multiple: reduction of the energetic consumption and thus of the global environmental footprint, increase of the cell life due to limited corrosion, reduction of production costs, etc. In this work, an overview of some properties of molten fluoride systems (Na?cryolite-based electrolytes (NaF?AlF3) and K?cryolite-based electrolytes (KF?AlF3)) is presented. To a lesser extent, the case of all-chloride and mixed chloro-fluoride salts is also discussed. Many physicochemical properties of salt mixtures are of major importance to evaluate the potential of a given electrolyte. When available, the following properties are reported and compared: the liquidus temperature, the electrical conductivity, the density, the vapor pressure, the solubility of alumina, and the solubility of liquid aluminum.},

	abstract = {A detailed picture of aqueous solvation of ions is central to the understanding of diverse phenomena in chemistry and biology. In this work, we report polarization resolved THz time domain measurements of the Raman spectral density of a wide range of aqueous salt solutions. In particular, the isotropic Raman spectral density reveals the frequency of the hydrogen bond formed between the halide ion and water. The frequency of this mode is measured for the series Cl?, Br?, and I? as a function of concentration, cation size, and charge. The frequencies extrapolated to zero concentration permit an estimation of the force constant of the mode, which is found to decrease with increasing halide mass and to be similar to the force constant associated with the water?water hydrogen bond. This result is consistent with recent calculations. The extrapolation of the frequency of the chloride hydrogen bond to zero concentration reveals a dependence of the frequency on the nature of the cation. This is ascribed to an interaction between the solvated anion and cation even at the lowest concentration studied here ({\textless}0.15 M). It is suggested that this behavior reflects the influence of the electric field of the cation on the hydrogen bond of an adjacent anion. Such interactions should be taken into account when modeling experimental data recorded at concentrations of ions in excess of 0.1 M. These measurements of the isotropic Raman spectral density are compared with those for the anisotropic response, which reflects the frequencies of the full range of hydrogen bonds in aqueous salt solutions. The anisotropic spectral density recovered can be modeled in terms of a concentration-dependent population of water?water H-bonds with a frequency unaffected by the ions, the halide?water hydrogen bonds, and a low-frequency collision-induced contribution.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic and transport properties for nitrate salts containing lithium, sodium, and potassium cations were computed from molecular simulations. Densities for the liquid and crystal phases calculated from simulations were within 4\% of the experimental values. A nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method was used to compute viscosities and thermal conductivities. The results for the three salts were comparable to the experimental values for both viscosity and thermal conductivity. Computed heat capacities were also in reasonable agreement with experimental values. The computed melting point for NaNO3 was within 15 K of its experimental value, while for LiNO3 and KNO3, computed melting points were within 100 K of the experimental values. The results show that very small free-energy differences between the crystal and liquid phases can result in large differences in computed melting point. To estimate melting points with an accuracy of around 10 K, simulation methods and force fields must yield free energies with an accuracy of around 0.25 kcal/mol. Tests conducted on a well-studied sodium chloride model indicated negligible dependence of the computed melting point on system size or choice of integration temperature.},

We show that the simulations performed with the simplified model do not provide a correct description of the properties of the system. First, the structure of the adsorbed electrolyte is partly modified. Second, dramatic differences are observed for the dynamics of the system during transient regimes. In particular, upon application of a constant applied potential difference, the increase in the temperature, due to the Joule effect, associated with the creation of an electric current across the cell follows Ohm?s law, while unphysically high temperatures are rapidly observed when constant charges are assigned to each carbon atom.},

	abstract = {The coherent-potential approximation (CPA) for single-particle properties of electrons in a disordered alloy AxB1-x (Soven and others) is extended to complex admittances. The one-electron Kubo formula is used. The CPA is viewed as a single-site decoupling of the averaged multiple-scattering expansion. It properly gives the exact formulas in the limits of weak scattering (Edwards) and of dilute alloys (Langer). For any x and any random-potential strength, CPA satisfies a number of physical conditions, including energy and particle-number conservation. The CPA equations are exactly soluble for a single-band model with short-ranged random scatterers. The vertex corrections are related to the response of local densities to a given disturbance. For the electrical conductivity σ, they vanish. Variation of σ with the randompotential strength is studied numerically. A low-mobility region appears well before the band splits. In the split-band limit, CPA yields a reasonable finite σ in the host band, but it fails in the impurity band.},

Recent developments enhance the efficiency of ADF (e.g., parallelization, near order-N scaling, QM/MM) and its functionality (e.g., NMR chemical shifts, COSMO solvent effects, ZORA relativistic method, excitation energies, frequency-dependent (hyper)polarizabilities, atomic VDD charges). In the Applications section we discuss the physical model of the electronic structure and the chemical bond, i.e., the Kohn–Sham molecular orbital (MO) theory, and illustrate the power of the Kohn–Sham MO model in conjunction with the ADF-typical fragment approach to quantitatively understand and predict chemical phenomena. We review the “Activation-strain TS interaction” (ATS) model of chemical reactivity as a conceptual framework for understanding how activation barriers of various types of (competing) reaction mechanisms arise and how they may be controlled, for example, in organic chemistry or homogeneous catalysis. Finally, we include a brief discussion of exemplary applications in the field of biochemistry (structure and bonding of DNA) and of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to indicate how this development further reinforces the ADF tools for the analysis of chemical phenomena. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {A generalization of normal ordering and of Wick’s theorem with respect to an arbitrary reference function Φ as some generalized “physical vacuum” is formulated in a different (but essentially equivalent) way than that suggested previously by one of the present authors. Guiding principles are that normal order operators with respect to any reference state must be expressible as linear combinations of those with respect to the genuine vacuum, that the vacuum expectation value of a normal order operator must vanish (with respect to the vacuum to which it is in normal order), and that the well-known formalism for a single Slater determinant as physical vacuum must be contained as a special case. The derivation is largely based on the concepts of “Quantum Chemistry in Fock space,” which means that particle-number-conserving operators (excitation operators) play a central role. Nevertheless, the contraction rules in the frame of a generalized Wick theorem are derived, that hold for non-particle-number-conserving operators as well. The contraction rules are formulated and illustrated in terms of diagrams. The contractions involve the “residual n -particle density matrices” λ , which are the irreducible (non-factorizable) parts of the conventional n -particle density matrices γ , in the sense of a cumulant expansion for the density. A spinfree formulation is presented as well. The expression of the Hamiltonian in normal order with respect to a multiconfiguration reference function leads to a natural definition of a generalized Fock operator. MC-SCF-theory is easily worked out in this context. The paper concludes with a discussion of the excited configurations and the first-order interacting space, that underlies a perturbative coupled cluster type correction to the MCSCF function for an arbitrary reference function, and with general implications of the new formalism, that is related to “internally contracted multireference configuration interaction.” The present generalization of normal ordering is not only valid for arbitrary reference functions, but also if the reference state is an ensemble state.},

	abstract = {Self-diffusion coefficients of sodium and chlorine in molten sodium chloride have been determined by the capillary method with the aid of \${\textasciicircum}\{22\}\$Na and \${\textasciicircum}\{36\}\$Cl radio-tracers. The results can be represented by the expressions D\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Na\}\}\$ = 8 \${\textbackslash}times \$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ exp (-4000/RT) and D\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Cl\}\}\$ = 33 \${\textbackslash}times \$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ exp (-8500/RT). These values, when inserted in the Nernst-Einstein equation (\${\textbackslash}Lambda \$ = (F\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$/RT) (D\$\_\{+\}\$+D\$\_\{-\}\$)), lead to a value of the equivalent conductance, A, which is about 40\% greater than that observed experimentally. The evidence that the diffusion coefficients of Na\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ and Cl\${\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ are similar in magnitude and that the activation energies are much smaller than the heat of vaporization of liquid sodium chloride, support the conclusions, derived from other evidence, that the free volume in the molten salt consists largely of holes, analogous to vacant lattice sites. On the basis of this model, the discrepancy in the Nernst-Einstein relation can readily be interpreted in terms of two diffusion mechanisms, one being normal vacancy diffusion of single ions, and the other a process in which no net charge is displaced in a unit step. It is suggested that the latter is the Seitz-Dienes mechanism of consecutive jumps of cation and anion in coupled vacancies. The interpretation mentioned enables the individual mobilities of Na\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ and Cl\${\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ ions to be determined, and hence their transport numbers can be calculated (t\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Na\}\}\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ = 0\${\textbackslash}cdot \$71, t\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Cl\}\}\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{-\}\$ = 0\${\textbackslash}cdot \$29 at 935 degrees C). The individual diffusion coefficients of the ions and of the coupled vacancies are in reasonable agreement with the Stokes-Einstein equation.},

	abstract = {Employing canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations, we report a calculation of the distribution of small ions next to a planar negatively charged surface in the presence of mixed electrolytes of monovalent and trivalent salt ions within the framework of the primitive model under more realistic hydrated ion size conditions. The effects of surface charge discreteness and dielectric breakdown on charge inversion are discussed based on increasing concentration of both monovalent and trivalent salt. Moreover, a comparison of the simulation results for different discretization models is made along with the case of uniformly distributed charge in terms of the ionic density profiles as well as the integrated charge distribution function. For finite size charged groups located inside the lower dielectric region, a complete equivalence with the case of uniform distribution is observed if the quantities of interest are exclusively analyzed as a function of the distance to the charged interface. With protruding head groups into the aqueous solution, the excluded volume dominates over the correlation effect, therefore the ions are less accumulated in the vicinity of the charged surface, inducing that the onset position of charge inversion experiences an evident shift toward the aqueous environment. Overall, the effect of repulsive image forces on the diffuse double layer structure can be significant at low surface charge density irrespectively of surface charge distributions.},

In all four cases the tagged-particle survival probability exhibits different asymptotic behavior. When the both boundaries are absorbing we also consider a case of a random interval length (single-file diffusion on a line with randomly distributed traps). In the latter setting, the initial concentration of particles has the same effect on the asymptotic decay of the survival probability as the concentration of traps.},

The features in the phonon density of states were found to change systematically with chemical short-range order in the alloy.

Systematic exploration of the parameters shows that the monohydrate binding energies can be consistent with a unique hydration free energy scale if the computed hydration free energies incorporate the contribution from the air/water interfacial electrostatic potential (?540 mV for SWM4-DP). The final model, which can satisfyingly reproduce both gas and bulk-phase properties, corresponds to an absolute scale in which the intrinsic hydration free energy of the proton is ?247 kcal/mol.},

	abstract = {We report the results of calculations of several shielding and antishielding effects pertaining to the hyperfine structure of various ions and atomic systems. The following shielding (or antishielding) parameters have been considered in the present work: (1) the parameter σ2 for the rare-earth ions, which measures the reduction of the A2r2P2(cosθ) term of the crystal field at the location of the 4f electrons due to the shielding effect of the more external 5s and 5p electrons; (2) the quadrupole antishielding factor γ∞ which gives the total quadrupole moment induced in the closed shells of an ion by the nuclear quadrupole moment Q; (3) the corresponding atomic shielding factor R which describes the effect of the induced quadrupole moment on the valence electrons; (4) the hexadecapole antishielding factor η∞, which is analogous to γ∞, except that it pertains to the induced hexadecapole (16-pole) moment produced by a possible nuclear electric hexadecapole moment. The calculated values of σ2 for the Pr3+ and Tm3+ ions are in good agreement with the experimental results. We have obtained improved values of γ∞ for the following ions: Al3+, Cs+, I-, Pr3+, and Tm3+. The atomic shielding factor R has been calculated for the 4f electrons of Pr3+ and Tm3+, and was found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment. A discussion is given of the most likely regions of atomic number for which it might be possible to detect a nuclear hexadecapole moment. In addition, an evaluation of the second-order terms in the antishielding factor γ∞ for the Cl- ion has been carried out. Expressions for γ∞(nl→l±2) for the case of hydrogenic wave functions have been obtained.},

@techreport{mesr_letat_2013,
	title = {L'état de l'emploi scientifique en {France} - {Rapport} 2013},
	abstract = {Les hommes et les femmes qui mettent leurs compétences au service de la recherche et de
l’enseignement supérieur constituent le cœur du système sans lequel recherche et enseignement
supérieur ne sauraient vivre et se développer. Enseignants, chercheurs, doctorants, personnels de
soutien, regroupés sous le terme d’« emploi scientifique », sont au cœur du système.
Cette édition 2013 de « L’état de l’emploi scientifique » a vocation à mieux les connaître car si les
données qui caractérisent ces personnels sont nombreuses, elles sont souvent dispersées et
fragmentaires, avec des dates d’observation différentes : les données n’ont pas le même millésime
selon les sources et selon les enquêtes, qu’elles soient nationales ou internationales.
Cet ouvrage a donc pour objectif de rassembler dans un même document des études et statistiques
diverses permettant d’éclairer les différents domaines d’activités des personnels qui relèvent de
l’emploi scientifique, conformément à l’article L411-2 du Code de la recherche.
Un premier thème explore la situation du « vivier », docteurs et doctorants qui assurent le
renouvellement régulier des chercheurs et enseignants-chercheurs, contribuent au fonctionnement
des laboratoires et à la production des savoirs. L’accent a porté cette année sur leur insertion
professionnelle, à partir des enquêtes Génération du CEREQ.
La diversité des carrières dans les établissements publics, universités ou organismes de recherche
fait l‘objet d’un examen spécifique. Outre les traditionnels aspects démographiques et statutaires, une
attention particulière a été accordée aux recrutements et aux caractéristiques des lauréats des
concours. De telles données permettent, par exemple, de constater que la féminisation se poursuit
lentement pour les corps de professeurs et directeurs de recherche.
Ensuite, la place de l’emploi scientifique dans le secteur privé illustre le dynamisme des activités de
recherche et développement. Elle traduit aussi le soutien apporté par le Ministère de l’Enseignement
supérieur et de la Recherche (MESR) au maintien de la compétitivité des entreprises par une
recherche au meilleur niveau, au travers de différents dispositifs de soutien à la R\&D, tel que le Crédit
impôt recherche (CIR) ou les Conventions industrielles de formation par la recherche (CIFRE) qui
encouragent les recrutements de scientifiques.
Enfin, l’attractivité internationale et la mobilité des scientifiques figurent parmi les priorités du MESR et
sont indispensables à l’accomplissement d’un véritable espace européen de la recherche.
L’implication dans les programmes européens et la politique d’accueil des scientifiques étrangers
illustrent cette problématique.
Œuvre collective pilotée par la Mission de l’emploi scientifique et du pilotage stratégique des
ressources humaines, ce volume met en regard les travaux conduits par différents services du
ministère et d’institutions partenaires. Leur collaboration s’avère indispensable pour une meilleure
compréhension de cet univers complexe et en perpétuelle évolution qu’est le système d’enseignement
supérieur et de recherche. L’équipe de la Mission de l’emploi scientifique espère que les efforts de
transparence et de synthèse contribueront à construire une vision partagée destinée à favoriser le
dialogue entre les acteurs de la recherche et de l’enseignement supérieur.
Ce rapport est aussi un outil de synthèse essentiel qui permet d’identifier les domaines où
l’information et la collecte de données peuvent encore être améliorées et où les efforts méritent d’être
approfondis afin de compléter une vision globale de l’emploi scientifique.},

We compute a number of electronic response coefficients in solution, such as global hardness and nuclear Fukui functions. The nuclear Fukui functions are found to be particularly sensitive to the chemical nature of the component species giving for Ag + a susceptibility 3.5 times the value for a H 2 O molecule while the result for Na + is more than a factor of 4 smaller compared to a solvent molecule. The electronic structure of the solution is further characterized by construction of effective molecular orbitals and energies. This analysis reveals that the effective highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the hard cation, Na + , remains buried in the valence bands of the solvent, whereas the HOMO of Ag + is found to mix with the lone pair electrons of its four ligand H 2 O molecules to form the (global) HOMO of the solution. This observation, highlighting the importance of the electronic structure of the solvent, is used to rationalize the results for the electronic response.},

This is illustrated on the example of the pyrophyllite clay. After presenting the most recent advances, we show that the strength of this implicit method is that: (1) it is in quantitative or semi-quantitative agreement with reference all-atom simulations (molecular dynamics here) for both the solvation structure and energetics, and (2) the computational cost is two to three orders of magnitude less than in explicit methods. The method remains imperfect in that it locally overestimates the polarisation of water close to hydrophylic sites of the clay. The high numerical efficiency of the method is illustrated and exploited to carry out a systematic study of the electrostatic and van der Waals components of the surface–solvent interactions within the most popular force field for clays, CLAYFF. Hydration structure and energetics are found to weakly depend upon the electrostatics. We conclude on the consequences of such findings on future force-field development.},

In the MD simulation we have used the site–site interaction model of methanol proposed by Haughney et al. [M. Haughney, M. Ferrario, and I.R. McDonald, J. Phys. Chem. 91, 4934 (1987)] and we have adopted a simplified, spherical core, model of methanol in the RHNC calculation. We find that the static dielectric constant is equal to 24 and the Kirkwood factor is 1.9 for the MD model. Although these values are not in good agreement with the corresponding experimental ones (32 and 2.94, respectively), we are able to show that the size of our system is large enough such that its static dielectric properties are consistent with those of a real fluid. Both MD and RHNC results for the wave vector dependence of the static dielectric tensor show that the longitudinal component of the dielectric permittivity is negative for almost the entire range of wave vectors studied. We argue that there is nothing unusual about this seemingly curious behavior, and that it should in fact be common to most polar liquids. The consequences of this behavior for the evaluation of free energies of solvation are outlined.},

Here, we demonstrate a computational approach to generate all conceivable MOFs from a given chemical library of building blocks (based on the structures of known MOFs) and rapidly screen them to find the best candidates for a specific application. From a library of 102 building blocks we generated 137,953 hypothetical MOFs and for each one calculated the pore-size distribution, surface area and methane-storage capacity. We identified over 300 MOFs with a predicted methane-storage capacity better than that of any known material, and this approach also revealed structure–property relationships. Methyl-functionalized MOFs were frequently top performers, so we selected one such promising MOF and experimentally confirmed its predicted capacity.},

The density matrix renormalization group provides the ability to describe static correlation in large active spaces, while the canonical transformation theory provides a high-order description of the dynamic correlation effects. We demonstrate the joint theory in two benchmark systems designed to test the dynamic and static correlation capabilities of the methods, namely, (i) total correlation energies in long polyenes and (ii) the isomerization curve of the [ Cu 2 O 2 ] 2 + core. The largest complete active spaces and atomic orbital basis sets treated by the joint DMRG-CT theory in these systems correspond to a ( 24 e , 24 o ) active space and 268 atomic orbitals in the polyenes and a ( 28 e , 32 o ) active space and 278 atomic orbitals in [ Cu 2 O 2 ] 2 + .},

Hence, solely the entropic contribution can induce their self-assembling even in the absence of attractive forces.

	abstract = {The challenges for further development of Li rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles are reviewed. Most important is safety, which requires development of a nonflammable electrolyte with either a larger window between its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or a constituent (or additive) that can develop rapidly a solid/electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer to prevent plating of Li on a carbon anode during a fast charge of the battery. A high Li+-ion conductivity (σLi {\textgreater} 10?4 S/cm) in the electrolyte and across the electrode/electrolyte interface is needed for a power battery. Important also is an increase in the density of the stored energy, which is the product of the voltage and capacity of reversible Li insertion/extraction into/from the electrodes. It will be difficult to design a better anode than carbon, but carbon requires formation of an SEI layer, which involves an irreversible capacity loss. The design of a cathode composed of environmentally benign, low-cost materials that has its electrochemical potential ?C well-matched to the HOMO of the electrolyte and allows access to two Li atoms per transition-metal cation would increase the energy density, but it is a daunting challenge. Two redox couples can be accessed where the cation redox couples are ?pinned? at the top of the O 2p bands, but to take advantage of this possibility, it must be realized in a framework structure that can accept more than one Li atom per transition-metal cation. Moreover, such a situation represents an intrinsic voltage limit of the cathode, and matching this limit to the HOMO of the electrolyte requires the ability to tune the intrinsic voltage limit. Finally, the chemical compatibility in the battery must allow a long service life.},

The mixed Fe---Cr interatomic potentials used were derived by fitting to the thermodynamic data of the disordered system and the measured lattice parameter changes of Fe upon Cr additions. The potentials predict phase separation as the most stable configuration for the central region of the phase diagram. The next most stable situation is the disordered b.c.c. phase. The structure of the screw 1/2 {\textless}111{\textgreater} dislocation core was studied using atomistic computer simulation and an improved visualization method for the representation of the resulting structures. The structure of the dislocation core is different from that typical of 1/2 {\textless}111{\textgreater} dislocations in pure b.c.c. materials. The core structure in the alloy tends to lose the threefold symmetry seen in pure b.c.c. materials and the stress necessary to initiate dislocation motion increases with Cr content. The mobility of kinks in these screw dislocations was also simulated and it was found that while the critical stress for kink motion in pure Fe is extremely low, it increases significantly with the addition of Cr. The implications of these differences for mechanical behavior are discussed.},

	abstract = {We have studied the geometry and singlet–triplet energy difference of two mono-nuclear Ni2+ models related to the active site in [NiFe] hydrogenase. Multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory based on a complete active-space wavefunction with an active space of 12 electrons in 12 orbitals, CASPT2(12,12), reproduces experimental bond lengths to within 1 pm. Calculated singlet–triplet energy differences agree with those obtained from coupled-cluster calculations with single, double and (perturbatively treated) triple excitations (CCSD(T)) to within 12 kJ mol−1. For a bimetallic model of the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenase, the CASPT2(12,12) results were compared with the results obtained with an extended active space of 22 electrons in 22 orbitals. This is so large that we need to use restricted active-space theory (RASPT2). The calculations predict that the singlet state is 48–57 kJ mol−1 more stable than the triplet state for this model of the Ni–SIa state. However, in the [NiFe] hydrogenase protein, the structure around the Ni ion is far from the square-planar structure preferred by the singlet state. This destabilises the singlet state so that it is only 24 kJ mol−1 more stable than the triplet state. Finally, we have studied how various density functional theory methods compare to the experimental, CCSD(T), CASPT2, and RASPT2 results. Semi-local functionals predict the best singlet–triplet energy differences, with BP86, TPSS, and PBE giving mean unsigned errors of 12–13 kJ mol−1 (maximum errors of 25–31 kJ mol−1) compared to CCSD(T). For bond lengths, several methods give good results, e.g. TPSS, BP86, and M06, with mean unsigned errors of 2 pm for the bond lengths if relativistic effects are considered.},

Our results illustrate that the salt precipitation patterns in drying porous media are nonuniform, manifesting the influence of the spatial distribution of pore sizes on the dynamics of salt crystallization and formation of discrete efflorescence. Results reveal that during stage-1 evaporation from saline porous media, the salt precipitation rate initially increases which is followed by a constant precipitation rate. This non-linear behaviour is attributed to the preferential liquid vaporization and salt precipitation in finer pores located at the surface of the porous medium contributing in evaporation according to the pore sizes. We also show that, contrary to common practice, the macroscopic convection-diffusion equation cannot provide accurate predictions for the dynamics of salt precipitation, at least at the early stages, due to the microscale heterogeneity of evaporation sites at the surface that results in salt precipitation exclusively in the finer pores.},

	abstract = {Most aqueous biological and technological systems contain solvated ions. Atomistic explicit-water simulations of ionic solutions rely crucially on accurate ionic force fields, which contain most commonly two adjustable parameters: the Lennard-Jones diameter and the interaction strength. Assuming these parameters to be properly optimized, the plethora of parameters one finds in the literature for one and the same ion is surprising. In principle, the two parameters should be uniquely determined by matching two ionic properties obtained for a particular water model and within a given simulation protocol with the corresponding experimental observables. Traditionally, ion parameters were chosen in a somewhat unsystematic way to reproduce the solvation free energy and to give the correct ion size when compared with scattering results. Which experimental observable one chooses to reproduce should in principle depend on the context within which the ionic force field is going to be used. In the present work we suggest to use the solvation free energy in conjunction with the solvation entropy to construct thermodynamically sound force fields for the alkali and halide ions for the simulation of ion-specific effects in aqueous environment. To that end we determine the solvation free energy and entropy of both cations and anions in the entire relevant parameter space. As an independent check on the quality of the resulting force fields we also determine the effective ionic radius from the first peak of the radial ion-water distribution function. Several difficulties during parameter optimization are discussed in detail. (i) Single-ion solvation depends decisively on water-air surface properties, which experimentally becomes relevant when introducing extrathermodynamic assumptions on the hydronium ( H 3 O + ) solvation energy. Fitting ion pairs circumvents this problem but leaves the parameters of one reference ion (here we choose chloride) undetermined. (ii) For the halides the problem is almost underdetermined, i.e., there is a whole set of degenerate parameters that equally well describe, e.g., chloride and bromide ions. (iii) For the heavy cations the problem is overdetermined, i.e., no combination of Lennard-Jones parameters is able to reproduce simultaneously energy and entropy of solvation. We discuss various possibilities to deal with these problems and finally present an optimized force field for the halide anions that reproduces the free energy and the entropy of solvation. For the alkali metal cations there is no unambiguous choice of parameters. Therefore, we give three different parameter sets for every ion with a small, intermediate, or large Lennard-Jones interaction strength, where the Lennard-Jones diameters are optimized to reproduce the solvation free energy. The ionic radius is reproduced with acceptable accuracy by this optimization strategy, meaning that the proposed force fields are reliable beyond the target observables (i.e., free energy and entropy of solvation).},

	abstract = {The computation of ionic solvation free energies from atomistic simulations is a surprisingly difficult problem that has found no satisfactory solution for more than 15 years . The reason is that the charging free energies evaluated from such simulations are affected by very large errors. One of these is related to the choice of a specific convention for summing up the contributions of solvent charges to the electrostatic potential in the ionic cavity, namely, on the basis of point charges within entire solvent molecules ( M scheme) or on the basis of individual point charges ( P scheme). The use of an inappropriate convention may lead to a charge-independent offset in the calculated potential, which depends on the details of the summation scheme, on the quadrupole-moment trace of the solvent molecule, and on the approximate form used to represent electrostatic interactions in the system. However, whether the M or P scheme (if any) represents the appropriate convention is still a matter of on-going debate. The goal of the present article is to settle this long-standing controversy by carefully analyzing (both analytically and numerically) the properties of the electrostatic potential in molecular liquids (and inside cavities within them). Restricting the discussion to real liquids of “spherical” solvent molecules (represented by a classical solvent model with a single van der Waals interaction site), it is concluded that (i) for Coulombic (or straight-cutoff truncated) electrostatic interactions, the M scheme is the appropriate way of calculating the electrostatic potential; (ii) for non-Coulombic interactions deriving from a continuously differentiable function, both M and P schemes generally deliver an incorrect result (for which an analytical correction must be applied); and (iii) finite-temperature effects, including intermolecular orientation correlations and a preferential orientational structure in the neighborhood of a liquid-vacuum interface, must be taken into account. Applications of these results to the computation methodology-independent ionic solvation free energies from molecular simulations will be the scope of a forthcoming article.},

	abstract = {We present a new theoretical framework, called Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory (MC-PDFT), which combines multiconfigurational wave functions with a generalization of density functional theory (DFT). A multiconfigurational self-consistent-field (MCSCF) wave function with correct spin and space symmetry is used to compute the total electronic density, its gradient, the on-top pair density, and the kinetic and Coulomb contributions to the total electronic energy. We then use a functional of the total density, its gradient, and the on-top pair density to calculate the remaining part of the energy, which we call the on-top-density-functional energy in contrast to the exchange-correlation energy of Kohn–Sham DFT. Because the on-top pair density is an element of the two-particle density matrix, this goes beyond the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem that refers only to the one-particle density. To illustrate the theory, we obtain first approximations to the required new type of density functionals by translating conventional density functionals of the spin densities using a simple prescription, and we perform post-SCF density functional calculations using the total density, density gradient, and on-top pair density from the MCSCF calculations. Double counting of dynamic correlation or exchange does not occur because the MCSCF energy is not used. The theory is illustrated by applications to the bond energies and potential energy curves of H2, N2, F2, CaO, Cr2, and NiCl and the electronic excitation energies of Be, C, N, N+, O, O+, Sc+, Mn, Co, Mo, Ru, N2, HCHO, C4H6, c-C5H6, and pyrazine. The method presented has a computational cost and scaling similar to MCSCF, but a quantitative accuracy, even with the present first approximations to the new types of density functionals, that is comparable to much more expensive multireference perturbation theory methods.},

In view of the known parametrized results for hard spheres, this observation introduces a new method in the theory of fluids, one that is applicable to any potential. The method requires the solution of a modified hypernetted-chain equation with inclusion of a one-parameter bridge-function family appropriate to hard spheres, and the single free parameter (the hard-sphere packing fraction) can be determined by appealing to the requirements of thermodynamic consistency. The assertion of universality is actually demonstrated via the application of this new method to a wide class of different potentials: e.g., hard spheres, Lennard-Jones, an inverse fifth power (r-5) applicable to the helium problem, the Coulomb potential (i.e., the one-component plasma), charged hard spheres, an oscillatory potential proposed for certain liquid metals, and the Yukawa potential.},

	abstract = {A novel stochastic Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) method has been developed and implemented in the Molcas software package. A two-step procedure is used, in which the CAS configuration interaction secular equations are solved stochastically with the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte-Carlo (FCIQMC) approach, while orbital rotations are performed using an approximated form of the Super-CI method. This new method does not suffer from the strong combinatorial limitations of standard MCSCF implementations using direct schemes, and can handle active spaces well in excess of those accessible to traditional CASSCF approaches. The density matrix formulation of the Super-CI method makes this step independent of the size of the CI expansion, depending exclusively on one- and two-body density matrices with indices restricted to the relatively small number of active orbitals. No sigma vectors need to be stored in memory for the FCIQMC eigensolver - a substantial gain in comparison to implementations using the Davidson method, which require three or more vectors of the size of the CI expansion. Further, no orbital Hessian is computed, circumventing limitations on basis set expansions. Like the parent FCIQMC method, the present technique is scalable on massively parallel architectures. We present in this report the method and its application to the free-base porphyrin, the Mg(II) porphyrin and the Fe(II) porphyrin. In the present study, active spaces up to 32 electrons and 29 orbitals in orbital expansions containing up to 916 contracted functions are treated with modest computational resources. Results are quite promising even without accounting for the correlation outside the active space. The systems here presented clearly demonstrate that large CASSCF calculations are possible via FCIQMC-CASSCF without limitations on basis set size.},

In this paper, we develop and demonstrate a new efficient method for an accurate non-local DFT. The method described here differs from previous work in the use of fast fourier transform (FFT) methods to carry out the convolutions. As with our previous real space work (J. Comput. Phys. 159(2) (2000) 407, 425), we demonstrate that the Fourier space approach can be solved with a Newton-GMRES approach; however, we now employ a very efficient matrix-free algorithm. A simple but effective preconditioner is presented. The method is demonstrated with calculations performed for one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems, including problems with single and multicomponent fluids.

	abstract = {A restricted active space (RAS) wave function is introduced, which encompasses many commonly used restricted CI expansions. A highly vectorized algorithm is developed for full CI and other RAS calculations. The algorithm is based on Slater determinants expressed as products of alphastrings and betastrings and lends itself to a matrix indexing C(I α, I β ) of the CI vector. The major features are: (1) The intermediate summation over determinants is replaced by two intermediate summations over strings, the number of which is only the square root of the number of determinants. (2) Intermediate summations over strings outside the RAS CI space is avoided and RAS calculations are therefore almost as efficient as full CI calculations with the same number of determinants. (3) An additional simplification is devised for M S =0 states, halving the number of operations. For a case with all single and double replacements out from 415 206 Slater determinants yielding 1 136 838 Slater determinants each CI iteration takes 161 s on an IBM 3090/150(VF).},

	abstract = {We model a fluid-filled disordered porous medium by a lattice-Boltzmann system with randomly broken links. The broken links exert a friction on the fluid without excluding volume. Such a model closely mimics the idealized picture of a porous medium, which is often used in the theoretical analysis of hydrodynamic dispersion. We find that the Brinkman equation describes both the mean flow characteristics and the spatial decay of velocity fluctuations in the system. However, the temporal decay of the velocity correlations (that a particle experiences as it moves with the fluid), cannot be simply related to the spatial decay. It is this temporal decay that determines the dispersivity. Thus, hydrodynamic dispersion is generally greater than theories based on spatial correlations would imply. This is particularly true at high densities, where such theories considerably underestimate both the magnitude and transient time scale for dispersion. Nonetheless, temporal velocity correlations are still ultimately screened and the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient converges exponentially. The long-lived transients reported for more realistic systems must therefore be due explicitly to the presence of excluded volume.},

	abstract = {The crystalline swelling properties and interlayer structure of a cesium montmorillonite clay were investigated using molecular computer simulations. Two classes of dry-clay structures, proposed previously to explain X-ray diffraction and NMR experiments, were identified using Monte Carlo annealing calculations. Hydrated clays with water contents ranging from 0.044 to 0.440 gH2O/gclay were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Layer spacings calculated as a function of water content were found to be similar to experimental swelling curves, showing a distinct plateau at the monolayer-hydrate spacing. Hydration energies were calculated as a function of water content and expressed in three complementary forms. The immersion energy form was found to be most useful, revealing an apparently global minimum in the swelling-coordinate energy that corresponds to the monolayer hydrate. This is in agreement with experimental measurements and may help clarify the energetic origins of discrete, crystalline swelling processes in clay minerals. For two- and four-layer hydrates, cesium ions readily formed two different types of inner-sphere complexes with the clay surface. Ions associated with negatively charged tetrahedral substitution sites formed exclusively inner-sphere complexes and occupied hexagonal cavities adjacent to the substitutions. Other cesium ions occupied both inner-sphere and outer-sphere configurations with roughly equal probability. The ease with which cesium associates with the clay surface may be responsible for the formation of monolayer hydrates in cesium-substituted clays and for selective binding of cesium to many clay minerals.},

	abstract = {It is often asserted that deviation from the Nernst−Einstein relation (NE) between the molar conductivity (Λ) and ion self-diffusion coefficients (Di) in ionic liquids (ILs) and molten salts is evidence for ion pairing. The NE was originally derived for noninteracting ions, as in an infinitely dilute electrolyte solution. In reality, mass, charge, momentum, and energy transport processes in ILs and molten salts involve correlated interionic collisions, caging, and vortex motions, as in any other dense liquid. Phenomenological theory using nonequilibrium thermodynamics and literature molecular dynamics simulations shows that deviations from the simple NE expression occur due to differences in cross-correlations of ionic velocities. ILs have also been shown, like molecular liquids generally, and model fluids such as the Lennard-Jones, to fit the fractional form of the Stokes−Einstein relation, Di/T (1/η)t and Λ (1/η)t, where η is the shear viscosity. Here, it is shown that when this is the case, the NE deviation parameter Δ is then a constant, independent of temperature and pressure (consistent with experiment) and the value of the parameter t; it is a function of the ionic charges and volumes, but not the masses. Therefore, Δ is not a measure of “ionicity”: it is necessary to seek other independent evidence to determine whether ion pairing is present in a given ionic liquid or molten salt. The use of “apparent” transport numbers derived from self-diffusion coefficients to describe charge transport in pure salts is argued to be unnecessary.},

Using perturbation methods we show that the leading order correction to the marginal probability distribution of particles in the case of soft confinement is equal to that obtained in the case of geometric confinement, provided that the (configuration) integral over the cross-section of the confining potential is equal to the width of the solid channel. We then calculate the probability distribution and average velocity in the case of a sinusoidal variation in the width of the channels. The reduction on the average velocity is larger in the case of soft channels at small Péclet numbers and for relatively narrow channels and the opposite is true at large Péclet numbers and for wide channels. In the limit of large Péclet numbers the convergence to bulk velocity is faster in the case of soft channels. The leading order correction to the average velocity and marginal probability distribution agree well with Brownian Dynamics simulations for the two types of confinement and over a wide range of Péclet numbers.},

The variation of correlation energies with the truncation radii of short- and long-range lattice sums and with the number of wave vector sampling points in the first Brillouin zone is examined for polyethylene, polyacetylene, and polyyne, and is shown to be a function of the degree of π-electron conjugation or the fundamental band gaps. The t 2 and t 1 amplitudes in the atomic orbital (AO) basis are obtained by first computing the t amplitudes in the Bloch-orbital basis and subsequently back-transforming them into the AO basis. The plot of these AO-based t amplitudes as a function of unit cells also indicates that the t 2 amplitudes of polyacetylene and polyyne exhibit appreciably slower decay than those of polyethylene, although the asymptotic decay behavior is invariably 1/r 3 . The AO-based t 1 amplitudes appear to correlate strongly with the electronic structure, and they decay seemingly exponentially for polyethylene whereas they stay at a constant magnitude across the seventh nearest neighbors of polyacetylene and polyyne, which attests to far reaching effects of nondynamical electron correlation mediated by orbital rotation. Nonetheless, the unit cell contributions to the correlation energies taper below 10 −6 hartree after 15 Å for all three polymers. The basis set dependence of the decay behavior of t 2 amplitudes is also examined for linear hydrogen fluoride polymer ( HF ) ∞ and linear beryllium polymer ( Be ) ∞ employing the STO-3G, 6-31G, and 6-31 G * basis sets, and proves to be rather small.},

	abstract = {The CIF2Cell program generates the geometrical setup for a number of electronic structure programs based on the crystallographic information in a Crystallographic Information Framework (CIF) file. The program will retrieve the space group number, Wyckoff positions and crystallographic parameters, make a sensible choice for Bravais lattice vectors (primitive or principal cell) and generate all atomic positions. Supercells can be generated and alloys are handled gracefully. The code currently has output interfaces to the electronic structure programs ABINIT, CASTEP, CPMD, Crystal, Elk, Exciting, EMTO, Fleur, RSPt, Siesta and VASP.Program summary

Licensing provisions: GNU GPL version 3
No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 12[thin space]691
No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 74[thin space]933
Distribution format: tar.gz
Programming language: Python (versions 2.4-2.7)
Computer: Any computer that can run Python (versions 2.4-2.7)
Operating system: Any operating system that can run Python (versions 2.4-2.7)
Classification: 7.3, 7.8, 8
External routines: PyCIFRW [1]
Nature of problem: Generate the geometrical setup of a crystallographic cell for a variety of electronic structure programs from data contained in a CIF file.
Solution method: The CIF file is parsed using routines contained in the library PyCIFRW [1], and crystallographic as well as bibliographic information is extracted. The program then generates the principal cell from symmetry information, crystal parameters, space group number and Wyckoff sites. Reduction to a primitive cell is then performed, and the resulting cell is output to suitably named files along with documentation of the information source generated from any bibliographic information contained in the CIF file. If the space group symmetries is not present in the CIF file the program will fall back on internal tables, so only the minimal input of space group, crystal parameters and Wyckoff positions are required. Additional key features are handling of alloys and supercell generation.
Additional comments: Currently implements support for the following general purpose electronic structure programs: ABINIT [2,3], CASTEP [4], CPMD [5], Crystal [6], Elk [7], exciting [8], EMTO [9], Fleur [10], RSPt [11], Siesta [12] and VASP [13-16].
Running time: The examples provided in the distribution take only seconds to run.

@article{lachand-robert_analyse_1993,
	title = {Analyse harmonique, distributions, convolution},
	volume = {A142},
	abstract = {L’analyse harmonique est, à l’origine, la branche des mathématiques qui traite des signaux périodiques, ou quasi périodiques (avec une définition que nous préciserons dans le cours de cet article). Introduite par Fourier pour l’étude de l’équation de la chaleur, où il remporta un grand succès, elle est très vite devenue un outil essentiel non seulement du mathématicien (pour la résolution de certaines équations, comme les équations des ondes ou les équations de convolution), mais aussi du physicien (pour les phénomènes d’ondes ou de propagation, l’optique, etc.), de l’astronome (mécanique céleste, spectroscopie), de l’électricien (équations des circuits électriques) ; elle trouve des applications même en musique (car les sons sont précisément des signaux sonores périodiques), d’où elle tire d’ailleurs son attribut d’harmonique. Ces applications n’ont rien perdu de leur importance, mais elles se sont augmentées de bien d’autres depuis qu’on a généralisé le concept de décomposition en série de Fourier, applicable aux seules fonctions périodiques, en une transformation de Fourier, utilisable sur un bien plus grand nombre de fonctions.

Les idées de base de l’analyse harmonique sont très simples, et peuvent essentiellement se résumer dans cette profession de foi : tout ramener à des fonctions de base dont les propriétés sont bien connues (fonctions sinus et cosinus, ou exponentielle), en exprimant les « fonctions générales » sous la forme de sommes, ou plus généralement d’intégrales, de telles « fonctions élémentaires ». Mais leur application pratique pose un certain nombre de difficultés tant sur le plan théorique (qu’est-ce au juste qu’une « fonction générale » ?) que sur le plan pratique (comment réaliser une telle décomposition, ou au contraire comment recomposer la fonction à partir de son expression dans ces fonctions élémentaires ; quelles sont les propriétés de l’image décomposée d’une fonction, etc.). Ces problèmes ont été énormément débattus par les mathématiciens depuis le siècle dernier, mais ce n’est qu’assez récemment qu’une solution pleinement satisfaisante a été trouvée, en fournissant un cadre élémentaire et général à la transformation de Fourier (et à bien d’autres questions mathématiques par ailleurs) : la théorie des distributions, conçue par L. Schwartz dans les années 50. Nous en exposerons donc en premier les principaux éléments, un peu comme on place le décor avant de commencer la pièce de théâtre. Nous évoquerons au passage le concept important de convolution de deux fonctions ou de deux distributions, qui joue un rôle essentiel par exemple en électronique ou en optique.

Nous expliquerons ensuite, dans la troisième section, la notion de transformée de Fourier, ainsi que ses propriétés usuelles. Les séries de Fourier, bien qu’antérieures historiquement, ne seront expliquées que dans la quatrième section, car leurs propriétés résultent très simplement de celles de la transformation de Fourier.

Le calcul pratique des transformées de Fourier, ou des séries de Fourier, est abordé dans la cinquième section. Il existe un certain nombre de méthodes algébriques permettant de passer d’une fonction à sa transformée, et réciproquement; de plus, les transformées d’un grand nombre de fonctions sont connues : nous en avons donné une liste assez longue, mais nullement exhaustive : il existe de gros tomes entièrement constitués de telles listes ! De nos jours, les ordinateurs permettent de calculer numériquement la transformée de Fourier d’une fonction définie par un certain nombre de valeurs (des mesures de laboratoire par exemple) ; aussi avons nous jugé important de parler de l’algorithme de transformation de Fourier rapide (bien connu sous son acronyme TFR).

La notion de transformation de Fourier a connu bien des développements depuis sa création, et la sixième section aborde un certain nombre d’entre eux : on y parle notamment de la transformation de Laplace, qui permet le traitement de fonctions qui n’ont pas de transformée de Fourier, et s’applique bien à la résolution de certaines équations différentielles, ainsi que d’une nouveauté très prometteuse qui prend beaucoup d’extension depuis sa création vers 1980 : la transformée en ondelettes.

Avant d’aborder ce programme, nous donnons une présentation de l’histoire assez mouvementée de l’analyse harmonique. Celle‐ci a évidemment un intérêt propre, mais également un but pédagogique ; car si nous avons expliqué les raisons qui rendent souhaitable un exposé basé sur les notions les plus générales et les plus exactes mathématiquement, seule la chronologie des découvertes permet de bien comprendre les raisons qui ont poussé de si nombreux savants à explorer ou approfondir ces domaines, en utilisant souvent des méthodes très approximatives – pour ne pas dire douteuses –, en l’absence de ces justifications théoriques précises qui sont données dans le reste de cet article.},

	abstract = {The influence of hydrodynamic screening near a surface on the dynamics of a single semiflexible polymer is studied by means of Brownian dynamics simulations and hydrodynamic mean field theory. The polymer motion is characterized in terms of the mean squared displacements of the end-monomers, the end-to-end vector, and the scalar end-to-end distance. In order to control hydrodynamic screening effects, the polymer is confined to a plane at a fixed separation from the wall. When gradually decreasing this separation, a crossover from Zimm-type towards Rouse (free-draining) polymer dynamics is induced. However, this crossover is rather slow and the free-draining limit is not completely reached—substantial deviations from Rouse-like dynamics are registered in both simulations and theory—even at distances of the polymer from the wall on the order of the monomer size. Remarkably, the effect of surface-induced screening of hydrodynamic interactions sensitively depends on the type of dynamic observable considered. For vectorial quantities such as the end-to-end vector, hydrodynamic interactions are important and therefore surface screening effects are sizeable. For a scalar quantity such as the end-to-end distance, on the other hand, hydrodynamic interactions are less important, but a pronounced dependence of dynamic scaling exponents on the persistence length to contour length ratio becomes noticeable. Our findings are discussed against the background of single-molecule experiments on f-actin [L. Le Goff et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 258101 (2002)]10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.258101.},

We derive general expressions for the fluxes of non-interacting particles and particles that strongly repel each other through the channel of varying cross section area, assuming that the transport is driven by the difference in particle concentrations on the two sides of the membrane. For a special case of a right truncated cone expanding in the left-to-right direction, we show how the fluxes depend on the geometric parameters of the channel and on the particle concentrations. For non-interacting particles the flux is direction-independent in the sense that inversion of the concentration difference leads to the inversion of the direction of the flux without changing its magnitude. This symmetry is broken for repelling particles: the flux in the left-to-right direction exceeds its right-to-left counterpart. Our theoretical predictions are supported by three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {Quantitative free energy computation involves both using a model that is sufficiently faithful to the experimental system under study (accuracy) and establishing statistically meaningful measures of the uncertainties resulting from finite sampling (precision). In order to examine the accuracy of a range of common water models used for protein simulation for their solute/solvent properties, we calculate the free energy of hydration of 15 amino acid side chain analogs derived from the OPLS-AA parameter set with the TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P-MOD, and TIP4P-Ew water models. We achieve a high degree of statistical precision in our simulations, obtaining uncertainties for the free energy of hydration of 0.02-0.06 kcal/mol, equivalent to that obtained in experimental hydration free energy measurements of the same molecules. We find that TIP3P-MOD, a model designed to give improved free energy of hydration for methane, gives uniformly the closest match to experiment; we also find that the ability to accurately model pure water properties does not necessarily predict ability to predict solute/solvent behavior. We also evaluate the free energies of a number of novel modifications of TIP3P designed as a proof of concept that it is possible to obtain much better solute/solvent free energetic behavior without substantially negatively affecting pure water properties. We decrease the average error to zero while reducing the root mean square error below that of any of the published water models, with measured liquid water properties remaining almost constant with respect to our perturbations. This demonstrates there is still both room for improvement within current fixed-charge biomolecular force fields and significant parameter flexibility to make these improvements. Recent research in computational efficiency of free energy methods allows us to perform simulations on a local cluster that previously required large scale distributed computing, performing four times as much computational work in approximately a tenth of the computer time as a similar study a year ago.},

The population of vacancies, interstitials and their clusters can however be followed only indirectly, for example by macroscopic resistivity measurements. The information on the mobility, recombination, clustering or dissociation of defects provided by such experiments is both extremely rich and difficult to interpret. By combining ab initio and kinetic Monte Carlo methods, we successfully reproduce the abrupt resistivity changes—so-called recovery stages—observed upon annealing at increasing temperatures after electron irradiation in α-iron. New features in the mechanisms responsible for these stages are revealed. We show that di-vacancies and tri-interstitials contribute to the stages attributed to mono-vacancy and di-interstitial migration respectively. We also predict the effect of the unexpected low migration barriers found for tri- and quadri-vacancies, and discuss the challenging questions raised by the mobility of larger defect clusters.},

We find that the solubility exhibits a minimum with respect to temperature at fixed pressure and thereby show that the Jagla fluid also displays water-like solvation thermodynamics. We further find low-temperature swelling of a hard-sphere chain dissolved in the Jagla fluid and relate this phenomenon to cold unfolding of globular proteins. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the presence of two characteristic lengths in the Jagla potential is a key feature of water-like solvation thermodynamics. The penetrable core becomes increasingly important at low temperatures, which favors the formation of low-density, open structures in the Jagla solvent.},

	abstract = {Hyperfine studies of disordered materials often yield the distribution of the electric field gradient (EFG) or related quadrupole splitting (QS). The question of the structural information that may be extracted from such distributions has been considered for more than fifteen years. Experimentally most studies have been performed using Mössbauer spectroscopy, especially on . However, NMR, NQR, EPR and PAC methods have also received some attention. The EFG distribution for a random distribution of electric charges was for instance first investigated by Czjzek et al [1] and a general functional form was derived for the joint (bivariate) distribution of the principal EFG tensor component and the asymmetry parameter . The importance of the Gauss distribution for such rotationally invariant structural models was thus evidenced. Extensions of that model which are based on degenerate multivariate Gauss distributions for the elements of the EFG tensor were proposed by Czjzek. The latter extensions have been used since that time, more particularly in Mössbauer spectroscopy, under the name `shell models'. The mathematical foundations of all the previous models are presented and critically discussed as they are evidenced by simple calculations in the case of the EFG tensor. The present article only focuses on those aspects of the EFG distribution in disordered solids which can be discussed without explicitly looking at particular physical mechanisms. We present studies of three different model systems. A reference model directly related to the first model of Czjzek, called the Gaussian isotropic model (GIM), is shown to be the limiting case for many different models with a large number of independent contributions to the EFG tensor and not restricted to a point-charge model. The extended validity of the marginal distribution of in the GIM model is discussed. It is also shown that the second model based on degenerate multivariate normal distributions for the EFG components yields questionable results and has been exaggeratedly used in experimental studies. The latter models are further discussed in the light of new results. The problems raised by these extensions are due to the fact that the consequences of the statistical invariance by rotation of the EFG tensor have not been sufficiently taken into account. Further difficulties arise because the structural degrees of freedom of the disordered solid under consideration have been confused with the degrees of freedom of QS distributions. The relations which are derived and discussed are further illustrated by the case of the EFG tensor distribution created at the centre of a sphere by m charges randomly distributed on its surface. The third model, a simple extension of the GIM, considers the case of an EFG tensor which is the sum of a fixed part and of a random part with variable weights. The bivariate distribution is calculated exactly in the most symmetric case and the effect of the random part is investigated as a function of its weight. The various models are more particularly discussed in connection with short-range order in disordered solids. An ambiguity problem which arises in the evaluation of bivariate distributions of centre lineshift (isomer shift) and quadrupole splitting from Mössbauer spectra is finally quantitatively considered.},

Inward relaxations of the first atomic interlayer distance of the Fe(1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces are found, while the second and third distances expand. At the (1 1 1) surface contractions of the first two layers are found, while the third one expands. The relaxation has a small effect on the surface energy and its influence on the work function is shown to be negligible for all orientations (less than 1.3\%). The calculated work function shows a strong anisotropy and is largest for the most compact (1 1 0) face. It is found that quantum-size effect does not influence the calculated surface characteristics.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamic properties of a system of N interacting Brownian particles immersed in a two-dimensional periodic potential in relation to superionic conductors. By varying the density of the mobile ions and the strength of the pair interaction, we investigate commensurability and correlation effects on the conduction process by an analysis of the diffusion coefficient. Both the Frenkel-Kontorova and Yukawa pair potentials between Brownian particles are used for this special investigation. Our numerical results, obtained form Langevin dynamics indicate a large difference between the transport properties of the one-dimensional and the two-dimensional systems, in the range of the weak pair interaction and for certain concentrations around 0.77. The maximum conductivity of two-dimensional conductors is predicted for concentration c = 23, while in the one-dimensional case it is always located at concentration c = 0.77. Furthermore we have evaluated analytically the dc-conductivity, in the two-dimensional case, for any value of the correlation length and for concentration c = 23. The analytical predictions are in good agreement with those of the numerical calculations.},

By simultaneously measuring the T1? and T2? relaxation times in addition to triple-quantum filtered relaxation times under the same spin-locking conditions, it is possible to separately quantify the contributions from the quadrupolar and the heterogeneous dipolar relaxation mechanisms. Thanks to the contribution from the residual quadrupolar coupling felt by the condensed lithium counterions, that procedure allows a broad dynamical range to be probed by performing spin-locking relaxation measurements using a limited number of irradiation powers. As illustrated by a multiscale modeling of the lithium diffusion and relaxation within such heterogeneous system, the frequency variation of the spectral densities characterizing the decorrelation of the quadrupolar coupling is a sensitive probe of the ionic mobility and the structure of the colloidal dispersion.},

These examples are used in order to validate the implementation of the 3D-RISM-KH method in the Amsterdam Density Functional package. The computations of the free energy difference in the trans/gauche conformational equilibrium for 1,2-dichloroethane in different solvents; the relative tautomerization free energy for cytosine, isocytosine, and guanine; and the free energy activation barrier for a CH3X-type (X = F, Cl, Br) S(N)2 reaction exhibit agreement with the experimental data. The method is also applied to the electronic and hydration structure of carbon single-wall nanotubes of different diameters, including the effect of water located in the inner space of the nanotubes. A comparison with continuum models of solvation (including COSMO) as well as with other more precise and computationally more expensive calculations is made to demonstrate the accuracy and predictive capability of the new KS-DFT/3D-RISM-KH method.},

The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40,000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions.

We present explicit numerical solutions of the RHNC theory for dense dipolar hard sphere fluids and detailed comparisons are made with previous theories and computer simulation results. It is found that the full RHNC theory generally improves upon the previous reference linearized and quadratic HNC approximations.

	abstract = {The segregation behavior of Cr in dilute Fe-Cr alloys is known to be anomalous since the main barrier for surface segregation of Cr in these alloys arises not from the topmost surface layer but from the subsurface layer where the solution energy of Cr is much more endothermic as compared to the topmost surface layer. The Fe-Cr alloys are candidate structural materials for the new generation of nuclear reactors. The surfaces of these alloys will be exposed to hydrogen or its isotopes in these reactors, and although hydrogen is soluble neither in Fe nor in Fe-Cr alloys, it is known that the adsorption energy of hydrogen on the surface of iron is not only exothermic but relatively large. This clearly raises the question of the effect of the hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of iron on the segregation behavior of chromium towards the surface of iron. In this paper we show, on the basis of our ab initio density functional theory calculations, that the presence of hydrogen on the surface of iron leads to a considerably reduced barrier for Cr segregation to both the topmost surface layer and the subsurface layer, but the subsurface layer still controls the barrier for surface segregation. This reduction in the barrier for surface segregation is due to the nature of the Cr-H couple that acts in a complex and synergistic manner. The presence of Cr enhances the exothermic nature of hydrogen adsorption that in turn leads to a reduced barrier for surface segregation. These results should be included in the multiscale modeling of Fe-Cr alloys.},

In this work we evaluate ϵT(k) for models of two classes. (1) In a DS model each molecule is a hard sphere with a point dipole at its center. It is the simplest representative of models in which the long range intermolecular interactions are generated by a set of point multipoles located at a single point in the molecule. In this case ST(k) is SM,T(k), the static correlation function of the transverse part of the dipole polarization density M(k). (2) In a ζDS model fluid, comprising nonideal dipolar hard spheres, the long range interactions are accounted for by two opposite partial charges on either side of the sphere’s center and separated by a distance l. The ζDS model is the simplest interaction site model (ISM) of a polar fluid. For an ISM the relevant structure factor ST(k) is SPμ ,T(k), the static correlation of the transverse part of the full electric polarization density vector Pμ(k). Here we compare ϵT(k) for DS and ζDS models with the help of the mean spherical approximation for the required structure functions. The ζDS–DS difference in ϵT(k) at large k is found to parallel the behavior of the static longitudinal dielectric function ϵL(k). However, ϵT(k), unlike ϵL(k), is a damped oscillatory function of k with no poles on the real k axis.},

All simulations were conducted for 250 ns to capture the dynamics of ion adsorption and to obtain the equilibrium distribution of multiple ionic species (Na+, Cs+, and Cl?) within the pores. The results clearly support the existence of ion-specific effects under confinement, which can be explained by the properties of interfacial water. Cl? strongly adsorbs onto the silica surface. Although neither Na+ nor Cs+ is in contact with the solid surface, they show ion-specific behavior. The differences between the density distributions of cations within the pore are primarily due to size effects through their interaction with confined water molecules. The majority of Na+ ions appear within one water layer in close proximity to the silica surface, whereas Cs+ is excluded from well-defined water layers. As a consequence of this preferential distribution, we observe enhanced in-plane mobility for Cs+ ions, found near the center of the pore, compared to that for Na+ ions, closer to the solid substrate. These observations illustrate the key role of interfacial water in determining ion-specific effects under confinement and have practical importance in several fields, from geology to biology.},

Although known to be due to chromium enrichment of a few atoms thick layer at the surfaces, the understanding of its complex atomistic origin has been a remaining challenge. We report an investigation of the thermodynamics of such surfaces at the atomic scale by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We use a Hamiltonian which provides a parametrization of previous ab initio results and successfully describes the alloy's unusual thermodynamics. We report a strong enrichment in Cr of the surfaces for low bulk concentrations, with a narrow optimum around 12 atomic percent chromium, beyond which the surface composition decreases drastically. This behavior is explained by a synergy between (i) the complex phase separation in the bulk alloy, (ii) local phase transitions that tune the layers closest to the surface to an iron-rich state and inhibit the bulk phase separation in this region, and (iii) its compensation by a strong and nonlinear enrichment in Cr of the next few layers. Implications with respect to the design of prospective nanomaterials are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {With the density functional theory outlined in paper I, we address and formally solve the nonlinear inversion problem associated with identifying the entropy density functional for systems with bonding constraints. With this development, we derive a nonlinear integral equation for the average site density fields of a polyatomic system. When external potential fields are set to zero, the integral equation represents a mean field theory for symmetry breaking and thus phase transformations of polyatomic systems. In the united atom limit where the intramolecular interaction sites become coincident, the mean field theory becomes identical to that developed for simple atomic systems by Ramakrishnan, Yussouff, and others. When the external potential fields are particle producing fields (in the sense introduced long ago by Percus), the integral equation represents a theory for the solvation of a simple spherical solute by a polyatomic solvent. In the united atom limit for the solvent, the theory reduces to the hypernetted chain (HNC) integral equation. This reduction is not found with the so‐called ‘‘extended’’ RISM equation; indeed, the extended RISM equation—the theory in which the HNC closure of simple systems is inserted directly into the Chandler–Andersen (i.e., RISM or SSOZ) equation—behaves poorly in the united atom limit. The integral equation derived herein with the density functional approach however suggests a rational closure of the RISM equation which does pass over to the HNC theory in the united atom limit. The new integral equation for pair correlation functions arising from this suggested closure is presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the Gaussian model of Li and Kardar [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 3275 (1991)]. When applied self-consistently to density fluctuations of a hard-sphere fluid, it is shown that the model gives the Percus-Yevick theory. With the addition of an attractive tail potential, the mean spherical approximation is obtained. Unlike the random-phase approximation, this appraoch determines the normal modes of the model consistent with the presence of an excluding manifold. The resulting fluid response in the presence of such an object is derived. For a D=1 manifold, the self-consistent approach is a theory of polymeric fluids. Here, with an averaging approximation, the reference-interaction-site-model (RISM) equation in the thread limit is obtained. For polymer blends, the analysis yields a seemingly exact formula for a demixing critical temperature. It scales linearly with polymer mass, as in Flory’s theory, but with an effective χ parameter smaller than that in Flory’s theory. The analysis sheds light on an erroneous prediction of different scaling made by others applying the RISM theory.},

Both static fields and alternating fields are considered. A mesoscopic simulation method is implemented to account in full for hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions. The response of the system can be characterized by two quantities: the mobility and the polarizability. Due to the interplay of the electrostatic attraction and hydrodynamic drag, the response of the microions close to the colloid surface is different from that of the microions far away from the colloid. Both the mobility and polarizability exhibit a dependency on the frequency of the external fields, which can be attributed to the concentration polarization, the mobility of the microions, and the inertia of microions. The effects of the colloidal charge, the salt concentration, and the frequency of the external fields are investigated systematically.},

	abstract = {Observation of the Brownian motion of a small probe interacting with its environment provides one of the main strategies for characterizing soft matter. Essentially, two counteracting forces govern the motion of the Brownian particle. First, the particle is driven by rapid collisions with the surrounding solvent molecules, referred to as thermal noise. Second, the friction between the particle and the viscous solvent damps its motion. Conventionally, the thermal force is assumed to be random and characterized by a Gaussian white noise spectrum. The friction is assumed to be given by the Stokes drag, suggesting that motion is overdamped at long times in particle tracking experiments, when inertia becomes negligible. However, as the particle receives momentum from the fluctuating fluid molecules, it also displaces the fluid in its immediate vicinity. The entrained fluid acts back on the particle and gives rise to long-range correlations. This hydrodynamic /`memory/' translates to thermal forces, which have a coloured, that is, non-white, noise spectrum. One hundred years after Perrin/'s pioneering experiments on Brownian motion, direct experimental observation of this colour is still elusive. Here we measure the spectrum of thermal noise by confining the Brownian fluctuations of a microsphere in a strong optical trap. We show that hydrodynamic correlations result in a resonant peak in the power spectral density of the sphere/'s positional fluctuations, in strong contrast to overdamped systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate different strategies to achieve peak amplification. By analogy with microcantilever-based sensors, our results reveal that the particle-fluid-trap system can be considered a nanomechanical resonator in which the intrinsic hydrodynamic backflow enhances resonance. Therefore, instead of being treated as a disturbance, details in thermal noise could be exploited for the development of new types of sensor and particle-based assay in lab-on-a-chip applications.},

In contrast, the Sternheimer model is shown to describe accurately the calculated EFG at the nucleus of the Na+ cation.

Systematic studies of basis set truncation errors have been carried out at the Hartree–Fock and coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) levels using extended correlation consistent basis sets with up to 398 basis functions. Correlation effects are investigated using a hierarchy of correlation methods extending up to the approximate inclusion of triples excitations by means of the CCSD(T) method. Rovibrational effects have been calculated combining accurate ab initio electric field gradient data and accurate experimental force fields. On the basis of the most accurate results for the electric field gradients, the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants for deuterium and oxygen-17 have been discussed including the temperature dependence. The final results are discussed in view of existing experimental data. Our best values for the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants are in excellent agreement (within 1\%) of recent experimental results, while some earlier experimental values are shown to be less reliable.© 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A departure from the conventional approach to the energy-band problem is achieved in three ways. First, it is noted that there is a critical atomic separation Rc≲(2.9±0.1) A such that for R{\textless}Rc electrons from atomic 3d orbitals that are directed along a ligand must be treated as collective electrons, for R{\textgreater}Rc the corresponding electrons are localized, Heitler-London electrons. Since the 3d wave functions are anisotropic, this implies that there may be localized and collective 3d electrons simultaneously present. Second, it is pointed out that localized electrons obey Hund's rule and may therefore contribute an atomic moment. This means the corresponding energy levels, or narrow bands, are split into discrete subbands. Any moment from collective 3d electrons is induced by the simultaneously present localized electrons via intra-atomic exchange. Third, it is asserted that if nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic order can be propagated throughout a lattice and the nearest-neighbor-directed 3d orbitals are half-or-less filled, the collective electrons (R{\textless}Rc) can be stabilized by bonding-band formation. If the orbitals are more than half filled, the "extra" electrons cannot be stabilized by antiferromagnetic correlations between nearest neighbors. If antiferromagnetic, nearest-neighbor order is not possible, the electrons form a conventional metallic band. These observations provide sharp criteria for Pauli paramagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, and ferromagnetism in transition metals and their alloys. They are used to explicitly introduce electron correlations into the construction of qualitative energy diagrams from which semiempirical density-of-states curves are constructed. The resulting model is shown to provide a consistent interpretation of phase stability, magnetic properties, electronic specific heats, Hall effect data, and form-factor measurements for the bcc and close-packed transition metals of the first long period and their alloys. The model is only partially successful for elements of the second and third long periods.},

However, no direct experimental verification of such a phase transition has been accomplished, and theoretical studies from different simulations contradict each other. We investigated the putative liquid-liquid phase transition using the Water potential from Adaptive Force Matching for Ice and Liquid (WAIL). The simulation reveals a first-order phase transition in the supercooled regime with the critical point at ∼207 K and 50 MPa. Normal water is high-density liquid (HDL). Low-density liquid (LDL) emerges at lower temperatures. The LDL phase has a density only slightly larger than that of the ice-Ih and shows more long-range order than HDL. However, the transformation from LDL to HDL is spontaneous across the first-order phase transition line, suggesting the LDL configuration is not poorly formed nanocrystalline ice. It has been demonstrated in the past that the WAIL potential provides reliable predictions of water properties such as melting temperature and temperature of maximum density. Compared with other simple water potentials, WAIL is not biased by fitting to experimental properties, and simulation with this potential reflects the prediction of a high-quality first-principle potential energy surface.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer.

In this work, we have obtained the spatialdistribution functionsg OO(r,Ω) and g OH(r,Ω) for liquid water and have applied them to an analysis of the equilibrium structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of SPC/E water have been carried out at temperatures of −10, 25, and 100 °C and the local liquid structure examined. It is found that the unfolded O...O distribution demonstrates, in addition to peaks consistent with a continuous tetrahedral network pattern, a distinct maximum in the local atomic pair density at ‘‘interstitial’’ separations of about 3.5 Å. This local maximum is lost in the spatially folded radial distribution functiong OO(r) due to averaging over the entire angular space. By examining the peaks in g OO(r,Ω) due to nearest neighbors, we have shown that the tetrahedral network coordination number in liquid SPC/E water equals 4.0 and does not depend on temperature. The average number of molecules in additional nontetrahedral coordination, which is found to vary with temperature, has also been extracted, enabling us to establish full average coordination numbers of 4.8–5.0 in the temperature range of −10–100 °C. In addition, we have determined and analyzedstatistical distributions for the pair energies and H‐bond angles for different water fractions as identified from g OO(r,Ω) and g OH(r,Ω).},

We used line shape analysis of the 23Na NMR spectra and measurements of the Hahn echo attenuation to quantify the degree of alignment of the individual clay particles along a single nematic director. As justified by simple dynamical simulations of the interplay between the sodium quadrupolar relaxation and its diffusion through the porous network limited by the surface of the clay particles, we probe the degree of ordering within these clay nematic dispersions by measuring the variation of the apparent 23Na NMR relaxation rates as a function of the macroscopic orientation of the clay dispersion within the magnetic field.},

A cascade of conical intersections connecting the V state in the Franck–Condon region to each of the low-lying Rydberg states has been identified, in addition to intersections connecting the excited state manifold back to the ground state. The D2d twisted geometry of ethylene is found to be a saddle point, not a local minimum. Pyramidalization of one of the methylene units in twisted ethylene is found to be favorable, leading to a conical intersection.

	abstract = {The structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules in confining or crowded environments are different from those in simple bulk liquids. In this paper, both the conformational and diffusional dynamics of globular polymers are studied in solutions containing fixed spherical obstacles. These properties are studied as a function of obstacle volume fraction and size, as well as polymer chain length. The results are obtained using a hybrid scheme that combines multiparticle collision dynamics of the solvent with molecular dynamics that includes the interactions among the polymer monomers and between the polymer beads and obstacles and solvent molecules. The dynamics accounts for hydrodynamic interactions among the polymer beads and intermolecular forces with the solvent molecules. We consider polymers in poor solvents where the polymer chain adopts a compact globular structure in solution. Our results show that the collapse of the polymer chain to a compact globular state is strongly influenced by the obstacle array. A nonmonotonic variation in the radius of gyration with time is observed and the collapse time scale is much longer than that in simple solutions without obstacles. Hydrodynamic interactions are important at low obstacle volume fractions but are screened at high volume fractions. The diffusion of the globular polymer chain among the obstacles is subdiffusive in character on intermediate time scales where the dynamics explores the local structure of the heterogeneous environment. For large polymer chains in systems with high obstacle volume fractions, the chain adopts bloblike conformations that arise from trapping of portions of the chain in voids among the obstacles.},

	abstract = {The response of a model microelectrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate blocking electrodes, which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The “weakly nonlinear” limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter ε=λD∕L, where λD is the screening length and L the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of λDL∕D (not λD2∕D), where D is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduces multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, L2∕D. In the “strongly nonlinear” regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multicomponent electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.},

	abstract = {Explicit expressions are given for the Fourier–Laplace transform of the van Hove function for fluids of particles interacting through orientation dependent pair potentials. The expressions are obtained from the Kerr approximation together with diffusion models for the self part of the van Hove function and apply at all frequencies and wavelengths. Both spherical (scalar diffusion constants) and nonspherical (tensorial diffusion constants) diffusors are considered and the theory is applied to k‐dependent dielectric relaxation and ion solvation dynamics. The required equilibrium structure is obtained using the hypernetted chain (HNC) or reference hypernetted chain (RHNC) theories and Kerr/RHNC(HNC) results are given for fluids of dipolar hard spheres, dipolar hard ellipsoids, and water‐like particles. Comparisons are made with earlier work based upon coupling equilibrium theories, such as the mean spherical approximation (MSA) for dipolar hard spheres with a dynamical equation of the Smoluchowski–Vlasov (SV) type. It is shown that for spherical diffusors with the self part of the van Hove function treated at the Fick–Debye level, the SV and Kerr equations are in fact equivalent. However, even for spherical diffusors, the results obtained can differ substantially depending upon the equilibrium theory and/or the molecular model employed. For nonspherical diffusors, the anisotropy of the rotational diffusion tensor can also be an important parameter influencing the k‐dependent dielectric relaxation.},

	abstract = {The solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water is special because liquid and gas are almost at coexistence. In the common hypernetted chain approximation to integral equations, or equivalently in the homogenous reference fluid of molecular density functional theory, coexistence is not taken into account. Hydration structures and energies of nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes are thus incorrect. In this article, we propose a bridge functional that corrects this thermodynamic inconsistency by introducing a metastable gas phase for the homogeneous solvent. We show how this can be done by a third order expansion of the functional around the bulk liquid density that imposes the right pressure and the correct second order derivatives. Although this theory is not limited to water, we apply it to study hydrophobic solvation in water at room temperature and pressure and compare the results to all-atom simulations. The solvation free energy of small molecular solutes like n-alkanes and hard sphere solutes whose radii range from angstroms to nanometers is now in quantitative agreement with reference all atom simulations. The macroscopic liquid-gas surface tension predicted by the theory is comparable to experiments. This theory gives an alternative to the empirical hard sphere bridge correction used so far by several authors.},

	abstract = {We present an extended implementation of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method combined with the quantum-chemical density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). In the previous study, we introduced the combined theory, referred to as DMRG-MRCI, as a method to calculate high-level dynamic electron correlation on top of the DMRG wave function that accounts for active-space (or strong) correlation using a large number of active orbitals. The DMRG-MRCI method is built on the full internal-contraction scheme for the compact reference treatment and on the cumulant approximation for the treatment of the four-particle rank reduced density matrix (4-RDM). The previous implementation achieved the MRCI calculations with the active space (24e,24o), which are deemed the record largest, whereas the inherent Nact8 × N complexity of computation was found a hindrance to using further large active space. In this study, an extended optimization of the tensor contractions is developed by explicitly incorporating the rank reduction of the decomposed form of the cumulant-approximated 4-RDM into the factorization. It reduces the computational scaling (to Nact7 × N) as well as the cache-miss penalty associated with direct evaluation of complex cumulant reconstruction. The present scheme, however, faces the increased complexity of factorization patterns for optimally implementing the tensor contraction terms involving the decomposed 4-RDM objects. We address this complexity using the enhanced symbolic manipulation computer program for deriving and coding programmable equations. The new DMRG-MRCI implementation is applied to the determination of the stability of the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin relative to the iron(V) electronic isomer (electromer) using the active space (29e,29o) (including four second d-shell orbitals of iron) with triple-ζ-quality atomic orbital basis sets. The DMRG-cu(4)-MRCI+Q model is shown to favor the triradicaloid iron(IV)-oxo state as the lowest energy state and characterize the iron(V) electromer as thermally inaccessible, supporting the earlier experimental and density functional studies. This conflicts with the previous MR calculations using the restricted active-space second-order perturbation theory (RASPT2) with the similar-size active space (29e,28o) reported by Pierloot et al. (Radoń, M.; Broclawik, E.; Pierloot, K. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011, 7, 898), showing that the hypothetical iron(V) state indicated by recent laser flash photolysis (LFP) studies is likely thermally accessible because of its underestimated relative energy.},

A backscattering area preceded by a shoulder has been identified as a signature of this function when evaluated for the subset of molecules that participate in two hydrogen bonds. Memory functions have also been evaluated. Their initial decay depends only slightly upon temperature. A more marked temperature dependence is observed for the nonassociated molecules.

	abstract = {For many decades, quantum chemical method development has been dominated by algorithms which involve increasingly complex series of tensor contractions over one-electron orbital spaces. Procedures for their derivation and implementation have evolved to require the minimum amount of logic and rely heavily on computationally efficient library-based matrix algebra and optimized paging schemes. In this regard, the recent development of exact stochastic quantum chemical algorithms to reduce computational scaling and memory overhead requires a contrasting algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented efficiently can often achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random errors. Additionally, they can exploit the continuing trend for massive parallelization which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level quantum chemical algorithms. In the Quantum Monte Carlo community, stochastic algorithms are ubiquitous but the discrete Fock space of quantum chemical methods is often unfamiliar, and the methods introduce new concepts required for algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we explore these concepts and detail an algorithm used for Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which is implemented and available in MOLPRO and as a standalone code, and is designed for high-level parallelism and linear-scaling with walker number. Many of the algorithms are also in use in, or can be transferred to, other stochastic quantum chemical methods and implementations. We apply these algorithms to the strongly correlated Chromium dimer, to demonstrate their efficiency and parallelism.},

	abstract = {We propose a derivation of the fluctuating lattice Boltzmann equation that is consistent with both equilibrium statistical mechanics and fluctuating hydrodynamics. The formalism is based on a generalized lattice-gas model, with each velocity direction occupied by many particles. We show that the most probable state of this model corresponds to the usual equilibrium distribution of the lattice Boltzmann equation. Thermal fluctuations about this equilibrium are controlled by the mean number of particles at a lattice site. Stochastic collision rules are described by a Monte Carlo process satisfying detailed balance. This allows for a straightforward derivation of discrete Langevin equations for the fluctuating modes. It is shown that all nonconserved modes should be thermalized, as first pointed out by Adhikari et al. Europhys. Lett. 71 473 (2005); any other choice violates the condition of detailed balance. A Chapman-Enskog analysis is used to derive the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics on large length and time scales; the level of fluctuations is shown to be thermodynamically consistent with the equation of state of an isothermal, ideal gas. We believe this formalism will be useful in developing new algorithms for thermal and multiphase flows.},

However, integrated rate laws for this class of chemical processes have so far only been found in certain special cases. Here, we present a model for the time dependence of an irreversible reaction between particles in a solution of finite volume and a surface. The resulting analytical expression allows to analyse quantitatively the transient kinetics of the reaction between soluble particles and a surface. We apply this approach to the analysis of quartz crystal microbalance experiments of protein aggregation under conditions where both reaction and diffusion define the overall kinetics. Furthermore, we use the model to determine absolute mass sensitivity coefficients for soft and rough surfaces, a situation where conventional approaches to determine the mass sensitivity a priori fail.},

	abstract = {We develop a new theoretical formulation to study ion conductance in electrolyte solutions, based on a mode coupling theory treatment of the electrolyte friction. The new theory provides expressions for both the ion atmosphere relaxation and electrophoretic contributions to the total electrolyte friction that acts on a moving ion. While the ion atmosphere relaxation term arises from the time-dependent microscopic interaction of the moving ion with the surrounding ions in the solution, the electrophoretic term originates from the coupling of the ion’s velocity to the collective current mode of the ion atmosphere. Mode coupling theory, combined with time-dependent density functional theory of ion atmosphere fluctuations, leads to self-consistent expressions for these two terms which also include the effects of self-motion of the ion under consideration. These expressions have been solved for the concentration dependence of electrolyte friction and ion conductance. It is shown that in the limit of very low ion concentration, the present theory correctly reduces to the well-known Debye–Huckel–Onsager limiting law which predicts a linear dependence of conductance on the square root of ion concentration (c). At moderate and high concentrations, the present theory predicts a significant nonlinear and weaker dependence on  which is in very good agreement with experimental results. The present theory is self-contained and does not involve any adjustable parameter. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

Near to liquid-gas coexistence where the chemical potential deviation δμ≡μ−μco(T)→0+ complete wetting by the gas (drying) occurs and a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian approach shows that the wall/liquid surface tension has a term in R−2∕3, i.e., a leading-order power-law nonanalyticity in the curvature (R−1) in the large cavity limit. For states sufficiently well removed from coexistence the surface tension can be expanded in integer powers of the curvature R−1, provided R{\textgreater}Rc with the length scale given by Rc=2γgl(∞)/(Δρδμ), where γgl(∞) is the planar liquid/gas surface tension and Δρ is the difference between the coexisting densities. However, even in these circumstances there are additional R−2lnR contributions to the surface tension arising from the dispersion forces. An exact statistical mechanical sum rule is used to relate the density of the fluid at the point of contact with the cavity, ρ(R+,μ), to the pressure of the reservoir and the surface tension. This predicts that ρ(R+,μ) acquires a term in R−5∕3 in the regime R{\textless}Rc. Numerical results obtained by applying classical density functional theory to this model confirm all the predictions from the coarse-grained approach for both the surface tension and the contact density. We argue that our results for leading-order nonanalytic contributions are exact, i.e., they should remain valid in the presence of interface fluctuations, and we discuss briefly the repercussions for solvation phenomena and for other wetting situations.},

We introduce a method to compare primitive-model Monte Carlo simulations of the ionic double layer with predictions of (mean-field) nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We also derive practical Derjaguin Landau Verwey Overbeek (DLVO)-like expressions that describe the Janus-particle pair interactions by mean-field theory. Using a large set of parameters, we are able to probe the range of validity of the Poisson-Boltzmann approximation, and thus of DLVO-like theories, for such particles. For homogeneously charged spheres this range corresponds well to the range that was predicted by field-theoretical studies of homogeneously charged flat surfaces. Moreover, we find similar ranges for colloids with a Janus-type charge distribution. The techniques and parameters we introduce show promise for future studies of an even wider class of charged-patterned particles.},

We present in details the experimental and theoretical characteristic features of the relaxation dispersion to support an interpretation in terms of coupled solid–liquid relaxation at pore interfaces, surface diffusion, and nuclear paramagnetic relaxation. The measurement does not require any drying temperature modification and is sufficiently fast to be applied continuously during the progressive hydration of the material. Coupling this method with the standard proton nuclear spin relaxation and high resolution NMR allows us to follow the development of micro-scale texture within the material.},

SANS experiments were coupled with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations. The structural information obtained by SANS and TEM is compared with the evolution of mechanical properties. Three main results have been obtained: (1) above 8.8 at.\% Cr in solid solution, the ferritic matrix is unstable at an aging temperature of 400 degreesC and separates into a Cr-depleted alpha and a Cr-rich alpha ' b.c.c. phase; (2) moreover, a strong radiation-accelerated or induced alpha ' precipitation is observed in alloys irradiated at 325 degreesC; (3) the precipitation of Laves phase Fe-2(Mo,W) is strongly dependent on the Mo and W content in the alloys.},

	abstract = {In addition to isomorphic cation substitutions, smectite layers may present anionic substitutions with fluorine replacing the structural hydroxyl groups and inducing a reduced number of H2O molecules hydrating interlayer cations. The resulting additional versatility of smectite layers could be used to fine-tune the hydrophilicity of pure or intercalated smectite pending a detailed understanding of interlayer water organization. The present article thus reports on the hydration of (fluoro-)hectorite samples exhibiting similar charge density (structural formulae: [Na0.8·nH2O]inter[Mg5.2Li0.8]oct[Si8.0]tetO20(OH,F)4). Water sorption isotherms and PIGE/PIXE analyses allowed constraining the water content over the probed range of relative humidity and the bulk chemistry, respectively. Modeling of X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles obtained along water vapor desorption isotherms allowed gaining additional insights in the distribution of interlayer H2O molecules. Compared to hydroxylated smectites of similar charge, fluorinated hectorites contain ∼30\% less interlayer H2O molecules although transitions between discrete hydration states are observed for similar values of relative humidity. These molecules (3–4 and 6–8 H2O molecules per cation in the mono- and bi-hydrated states, respectively) predominantly belong to the hydration sphere of interlayer cations, although additional H2O molecules are present in the bi-hydrated state. As a consequence, the positional disorder of interlayer H2O molecules is much reduced in fluorinated samples, thus increasing the minimum distance from an interlayer H2O molecule to the smectite layer, most likely owing to the hydrophobicity of fluorinated layers. Finally, the distribution of layers with a given hydration state is more heterogeneous within smectite crystals for fluorinated smectites, compared to hydroxylated ones, possibly as the result of the improved crystallinity.},

	abstract = {The time dependence of the mean-square displacement (or equivalently of the diffusion coefficient) in the presence of a permeable barrier can be used as a probe of the surface-to-volume ratio and permeability of a membrane. An exact, universal, short-time asymptotics in a pack of cells, assuming that the surfaces are locally smooth, shows that the effects of nonzero permeability appear as a correction to the diffusion coefficient that is linear in time, whereas the surface-to-volume ratio enters as a square root in time. With κ as the permeability of the membrane, we find, for the particles released inside the cells, DR,eff(t) = DR[1−(SR/VR)\{4t/(9)−κt(+)/(6DR)\}]+⋯ . Here DR and DL are free (i.e., bulk) diffusion coefficients inside and outside of the cell, respectively, and SR/VR is the total internal surface divided by the total internal cell volume. The other terms linear in t that add to the right side of above equation are DR(SR/VR)[(1/6)ρt−(1/12)DRt〈(1/R1+1/R2)〉R], where ρ is a surface relaxation, which is generally negligible in biological samples, and 〈(1/R1+1/R2)〉R is the average of the principal radii of curvatures over the interior surface. An equivalent expression for the particles starting outside the cell is obtained by swapping L↔R. The NMR data on erthrocytes show that the effect of permeability can be significant within the time scales of measurement and hence κ is deducible from the data. The long-time behavior given previously [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We suggest an alternate, robust determination based on the stable states picture (SSP) of chemical reactions (J. Chem. Phys. 1980, 73, 2700?2714) where recrossing is naturally discarded. This is illustrated by calculation of the water residence time next to a water molecule and next to a chloride ion, using both nonpolarizable and polarizable force-fields. The SSP results are in good agreement with the residence times estimated by a separate kinetic analysis, and differ noticeably from those calculated in the conventional fashion mentioned above.},

As a first application, we question the validity of the appealing interspin procedure [

A. Borel et al., Chem. Eur. J. 7, 600 (2001)
] based on the solutions of a Smoluchowski diffusion equation, which conserve the interspin radial distribution function in the course of time. We show that the true random spatial motion of the interspin vector obtained by simulation can be very different from that given by the Smoluchowski solutions and lead to notable retardation of the time decay of the OS-DTCF. Then, we explore the influence of the solvation properties of MS on the decay rate of the DTCF. When MS is significantly larger than MI, its rotation accelerates the decay only weakly, even if MI follows MS in its Brownian tumbling. By contrast, viscous solvation layers in OS pockets of MS can yield an important local slowdown of the relative translational diffusion of MI, leading to a decay retardation of the DTCF, which adds to that due to the shape anisotropy of MS. When MS is a Gd3+-based contrast agent, this retardation leads to a notable increase of the OS contribution to relaxivity even at rather high imaging field.},

In this study, we used two different models of neopentane: One is of single united site (UA) and another contains five-sites. We observe that, these two neopentane models behave differently in pure water as well as solutions containing osmolytes. Presence of urea molecules increases the stability of solvent-separated state for five-site model, whereas osmolytes have negligible effect in regard to clustering of UA model of neopentane. For both models, dehydration of neopentane and preferential solvation of it by urea and TMAO over water molecules are also observed. We also find the collapse of the second-shell of water by urea and water structure enhancement by TMAO. The orientational distributions of water molecules around different layers of neopentane were also calculated and we find that orientation of water molecules near to hydrophobic moiety is anisotropic and osmolytes have negligible effect on it. We also observe osmolyte-induced water-water hydrogen bond life time increase in the hydration shell of neopentane as well as in the subsequent water layers.},

	abstract = {Direct coexistence simulations between the fluid and solid phases are performed for several ices. For ices Ih and VII it has already been shown that the methodology is successful and the melting point is in agreement with that obtained from free energy calculations. In this work the methodology is applied to ices II, III, V, and VI. The lengths of the direct coexistence runs for the high pressure polymorphs are not too long and last less than 20 ns for all ices except for ice II where longer runs (of about 150 ns) are needed. For ices II, V, and VI the results obtained are completely consistent with those obtained from free energy calculations. However, for ice III it is found that the melting point from direct coexistence simulations is higher than that obtained from free energy calculations, the difference being greater than the statistical error. Since ice III presents partial proton orientational disorder, the departure is attributed to differences in the partial proton order in the water model with respect to that found in the experiment. The phase diagram of the TIP4P/2005 model is recalculated using the melting points obtained from direct coexistence simulations. The new phase diagram is similar to the previous one except for the coexistence lines where ice III is involved. The range of stability of ice III on the p-T plot of the phase diagram increases significantly. It is seen that the model qualitatively describes the phase diagram of water. In this work it is shown that the complete phase diagram of water including ices Ih, II, III, V, VI, VII, and the fluid phase can be obtained from direct coexistence simulations without the need of free energy calculations.},

We use the MB model of water, a simple two-dimensional statistical mechanical model in which waters are represented as Lennard-Jones disks having Gaussian hydrogen-bonding arms. We introduce a charge dipole into MB waters. We perform (NPT) Monte Carlo simulations to explore how water molecules are organized around ions and around nonpolar solutes in salt solutions. The model gives good qualitative agreement with experiments, including Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients, Samoilov and Hirata ion hydration activation energies, ion solvation thermodynamics, and Setschenow coefficients for Hofmeister series ions, which describe the salt concentration dependence of the solubilities of hydrophobic solutes. The two main ideas captured here are (1) that charge densities govern the interactions of ions with water, and (2) that a balance of forces determines water structure: electrostatics (water's dipole interacting with ions) and hydrogen bonding (water interacting with neighboring waters). Small ions (kosmotropes) have high charge densities so they cause strong electrostatic ordering of nearby waters, breaking hydrogen bonds. In contrast, large ions (chaotropes) have low charge densities, and surrounding water molecules are largely hydrogen bonded.},

The results indicate a two-step reduction process for uranium(IV). The first step U(IV)/U(III) exchanging one electron corresponds to a soluble/soluble system and is limited by U(IV) diffusion with DU(IV) = 1.25 ± 0.35 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 in LiF–NaF at 720 °C.

In order to perform a thorough study of the second step U(III)/U(0) in the reduction process, the melt was chemically reduced in U(III) with U metal as reducing agent. Alternatively to the use of LiF–NaF where U metal is unstable at 720 °C, the chemical reduction of U(IV) in U(III) was performed in a LiF–CaF2–UF4 solution containing U metal at 810 °C. It has been confirmed that the reduction of U(III) proceeds in one step exchanging three electrons and by a diffusion controlled process with DU(III) = 2.2 ± 0.7 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 in LiF–CaF2 at 810 °C.},

The structure exhibits drastic change when the solute size dM/dS (dM and dS are diameters of the solute and a water molecule, respectively) increases from 1 to 2. As the solute size increases further, the density structure converges to the planar-wall limit quite rapidly, while the convergence of the orientational structure is slower. The orientation of molecules neighboring the solute can be characterized by a mixture of the two opposite orientations unique to dM/dS=1 and to the planar-wall limit. They contribute to the structure almost equally for 2\&lt;dM/dS\&lt;3. As dM increases, the contribution from the orientation for the planar-wall limit becomes larger and it dominates for dM/dS≥5.},

Molecular-dynamics calculations with 32 and 108 particles have been carried out with running construction of the mapping to potential minima. This determines the distribution of stable packings according to their potential energy and shows how transition rates between alternative structures vary with total system energy. Melting and freezing events have been monitored in this manner. We observe occasional transitions in localized "two-state" (bistable) systems in strongly supercooled amorphous states. Transitions in fluid states display a peculiar intermittency that may have relevance to self-diffusion and viscous flow.},

At a dimension slightly less than 6, the effect is nontrivial but tractable by perturbation theory. We carry out a renormalization-group analysis and determine the dynamic exponent z=4-ε/2=1+d/2, accurate to O(ε). We also solve the equation of motion to obtain the spin response function. The frequency and damping of spin waves below Tc are determined. Forms of equations of motion and the extent of universality in critical dynamics are discussed.},

	abstract = {Purpose The pore space anisotropy of pharmaceutical compacts was evaluated in relation to the mechanical property anisotropy. Methods The topology and the pore space anisotropy were characterized by PGSTE-NMR measurements. Parallelepipedical compacts of anhydrous calcium phosphate (aCP) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) were tested on top, bottom and side faces. A microindentation and three-point single beam tests were used to measure Brinell hardness, tensile strength and Young’s modulus. All the data were submitted to a statistical analysis to test for significance. Results The porous structure of MCC compacts was anisotropic, contrary to those of aCP. The analysis of the pore space by PGSTE-NMR method showed that its structural anisotropy was controlled by the behaviour under compaction of the excipients. At the same time, the Young’s modulus and the tensile strength were the same whatever the direction of testing. For the aCP compacts, all the faces had the same Brinell hardness. With MCC compacts, only the bottom face showed a lower Brinell hardness. Conclusions Except for Brinell hardness measured on MCC compacts, the tested samples were characterized by anisotropic mechanical properties when its porous structures were sometimes anisotropic. Then, there is not a straight link between porosity anisotropy and mechanical properties.},

Advanced materials can enable improved reactor performance via increased safety margins and design flexibility, in particular by providing increased strength, thermal creep resistance and superior corrosion and neutron radiation damage resistance. In many cases, a key strategy for designing high-performance radiation-resistant materials is based on the introduction of a high, uniform density of nanoscale particles that simultaneously provide good high temperature strength and neutron radiation damage resistance.},

	abstract = {To begin to elucidate the principles of intermolecular dynamics in the crowded environment of cells, employing brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, we examined possible mechanism(s) responsible for the great reduction in diffusion constants of macromolecules in vivo from that at infinite dilution. In an Escherichia coli cytoplasm model comprised of 15 different macromolecule types at physiological concentrations, BD simulations of molecular-shaped and equivalent sphere representations were performed with a soft repulsive potential. At cellular concentrations, the calculated diffusion constant of GFP is much larger than experiment, with no significant shape dependence. Next, using the equivalent sphere system, hydrodynamic interactions (HI) were considered. Without adjustable parameters, the in vivo experimental GFP diffusion constant was reproduced. Finally, the effects of nonspecific attractive interactions were examined. The reduction in diffusivity is very sensitive to macromolecular radius with the motion of the largest macromolecules dramatically slowed down; this is not seen if HI dominate. In addition, long-lived clusters involving the largest macromolecules form if attractions dominate, whereas HI give rise to significant, size independent intermolecular dynamic correlations. These qualitative differences provide a testable means of differentiating the importance of HI vs. nonspecific attractive interactions on macromolecular motion in cells.},

	abstract = {A generalization of normal ordering and of Wick’s theorem with respect to an arbitrary reference function Φ as some generalized “physical vacuum” is formulated in a different (but essentially equivalent) way than that suggested previously by one of the present authors. Guiding principles are that normal order operators with respect to any reference state must be expressible as linear combinations of those with respect to the genuine vacuum, that the vacuum expectation value of a normal order operator must vanish (with respect to the vacuum to which it is in normal order), and that the well-known formalism for a single Slater determinant as physical vacuum must be contained as a special case. The derivation is largely based on the concepts of “Quantum Chemistry in Fock space,” which means that particle-number-conserving operators (excitation operators) play a central role. Nevertheless, the contraction rules in the frame of a generalized Wick theorem are derived, that hold for non-particle-number-conserving operators as well. The contraction rules are formulated and illustrated in terms of diagrams. The contractions involve the “residual n -particle density matrices” λ , which are the irreducible (non-factorizable) parts of the conventional n -particle density matrices γ , in the sense of a cumulant expansion for the density. A spinfree formulation is presented as well. The expression of the Hamiltonian in normal order with respect to a multiconfiguration reference function leads to a natural definition of a generalized Fock operator. MC-SCF-theory is easily worked out in this context. The paper concludes with a discussion of the excited configurations and the first-order interacting space, that underlies a perturbative coupled cluster type correction to the MCSCF function for an arbitrary reference function, and with general implications of the new formalism, that is related to “internally contracted multireference configuration interaction.” The present generalization of normal ordering is not only valid for arbitrary reference functions, but also if the reference state is an ensemble state.},

The approach is based on a heuristic development starting from a resolution of the force–force correlation function of a Brownian ion, into parts depending on the attractive ion–solvent interaction and a repulsive, hard core ion–solvent interaction. We show that in the limit of infinitely weak, long range attractive ion–solvent interactions the molecular theory reduces to the phenomenological dielectric friction picture for the drag on an ion. The molecular theory also gives sensible results in the case of strong, short range attractive interactions. In this case the theory essentially indicates that the drag on the ion reduces to the drag on a composite body, i.e., a solventberg consisting of the ion and the molecules in the first solvation shell.},

	abstract = {The stability of liquids under solvophobic confinement can tip in favor of the vapor phase, nucleating a liquid-to-vapor phase transition that induces attractive forces between confining surfaces. In the case of water adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces, experimental and theoretical evidence support confinement-mediated evaporation stabilization of biomolecular and colloidal assemblies. The macroscopic thermodynamic theory of cavitation under confinement establishes the connection between the size of the confining surfaces, interfacial free energies, and bulk solvent pressure with the critical evaporation separation and interfacial forces. While molecular simulations have confirmed the broad theoretical trends, a quantitative comparison based on independent measurements of the interfacial free energies and liquid-vapor coexistence properties has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been performed. To overcome the challenges of simulating a large number of systems to validate scaling predictions for a three-dimensional fluid, we simulate both the forces and liquid-vapor coexistence properties of a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid confined between solvophobic plates over a range of plate sizes and reservoir pressures. Our simulations quantitatively agree with theoretical predictions for solvent-mediated forces and critical evaporation separations once the length dependence of the solvation free energy of an individual confining plate is taken into account. The effective solid-liquid line tension length dependence results from molecular scale correlations for solvating microscopic plates and asymptotically decays to the macroscopic value for plates longer than 150 solvent diameters. The success of the macroscopic thermodynamic theory at describing two-dimensional liquids suggests application to surfactant monolayers to experimentally confirm confinement-mediated cavitation.},

This system forms no solid compounds involving both lithium and potassium and exhibits a eutectic close to the equimolar composition. Simulations at various melt compositions allow the liquidus to be determined and compared with experiment. In order to test the precision achievable by a direct simulation of coexisting liquid and solid phases for the thermodynamic properties, we make preliminary calculations on the melting of a model of NaCl, which has recently been studied by Anwar et al. [2003, J. chem. Phys., 118, 728] using thermodynamic integration. Including anionic polarization, effects in the interionic interaction model lower the melting temperature, despite the fact that there is no discernible effect on the liquid or solid structure in these simple monovalent melts. The method of direct simulation of coexistence also allows for the study of the interfacial structure and dynamics. These can be compared with previous studies [Davidchack, R. L., and Laird, B. B., 1998, J. chem. Phys., 108, 9452; Sibug-Aga, R., and Laird, B. B., 2002, J. chem. Phys., 116, 3410] of the solid–liquid interfaces in binary mixtures of hard spheres of sufficiently different size ratio to prevent solid compound formation. Despite the additional Coulombic interactions the ionic interfaces resemble the hard spheres in many regards, but there are differences. For example, when traversing the interface the perpendicular diffusion rises more rapidly than the parallel diffusion, most likely due to charge ordering.},

In other words, why does ‘nanofluidics’ deserve its own brand name? In this critical review, we will explore the vast manifold of length scales emerging for fluid behavior at the nanoscale, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications. We will in particular explore the interplay between bulk and interface phenomena. The limit of validity of the continuum approaches will be discussed, as well as the numerous surface induced effects occurring at these scales, from hydrodynamic slippage to the various electro-kinetic phenomena originating from the couplings between hydrodynamics and electrostatics.

The observed dynamics depend significantly on solute charge and on which multipole moment of the solute is perturbed. In all cases, the solvation response has a two‐part character. One part consists of a fast initial relaxation and attendant oscillations, both of which occur on a time scale of 0.1–0.2 ps. The initial response is well fit by a Gaussian function and accounts for ∼80\% of the total relaxation. The second dynamical component occurs on a much slower, ∼1 ps time scale, and accounts for the remainder of the relaxation. The fast response results from small amplitude inertial dynamics of solvent molecules within the confines of their instantaneous environment. The slow component reflects larger amplitude motions involving the breakup and reorganization of these local environments, especially in the first solvation shell of the solute. Comparison of the observed solvation dynamics to predictions of available theories points out the inadequacy of the latter due to their neglect of inertial parts of the solvent dielectric response.},

Kurashige and T. Yanai, J. Chem. Phys.135, 094104 (2011)]. In the previous study, the combined theory, referred to as DMRG-CASPT2, was built upon the use of pseudo-canonical molecular orbitals (PCMOs) for one-electron basis. Within the PCMO basis, the construction of the four-particle reduced density matrix (4-RDM) using DMRG can be greatly facilitated because of simplicity in the multiplication of 4-RDM and diagonal Fock matrix in the CASPT2 equation. In this work, we develop an approach to use more suited orbital basis in DMRG-CASPT2 calculations, e.g., localized molecular orbitals, in order to extend the domain of applicability. Because the multiplication of 4-RDM and generalized Fock matrix is no longer simple in general orbitals, an approximation is made to it using the cumulant reconstruction neglecting higher-particle cumulants. Also, we present the details of the algorithm to compute 3-RDM of the DMRG wavefunction as an extension of the 2-RDM algorithm of Zgid et al. [J. Chem. Phys.128, 144115 (2008)] and Chan et al. [J. Chem. Phys.128, 144117 (2008)]. The performance of the extended DMRG-CASPT2 approach was examined for large-scale multireference systems, such as low-lying excited states of long-chain polyenes and isomerization potential of \{[Cu(NH3)3]2O2\}2+.},

The calculations predict certain anomalies in the cohesive properties of ferromagnetic alloys at a concentration of about 7 at \% Cr; these anomalies may be related to the changes in Fermi-surface topology that occur with composition in this alloy system. The obtained interatomic interactions are used as parameters in the configurational (Ising) and magnetic (Heisenberg) Hamiltonians for modeling finite-temperature thermodynamic properties of the alloys. We discuss the approximations and limitations of similar modeling approaches, investigate the origin of existing difficulties, and analyze possible ways of extending the theoretical models in order to capture the essential physics of interatomic interactions in the Fe-Cr or similar alloys where magnetism plays a crucial role in the phase stability.},

Migrating atoms are reflected at the boundaries of the (110), (211), and (321) planes; on the latter two, motion along atomic rows is favored over diffusion across lattice steps. From quantitative determinations of the rate of change of the mean‐square displacement, diffusion coefficients are obtained as follows: (110), D = 3×10−2exp(−22000/RT)cm2/sec; (321), 1×10−3exp(−20000/RT); (211), 2×10−7exp(−13000/RT).

In the calculation of these factors, we utilize two types of number representation: the prime number representation for the prefactor, and the 32768-base number representation for the summation terms. This makes it possible to tabulate or exactly calculate the coupling and recoupling coefficients for any large angular momenta. Instead of evaluating a large number of factorials of integers, we also compute the binomial coefficients recursively at every stage, which dramatically increases the efficiency of calculation. Hence, a direct method for very fast and exact calculation of coupling and recoupling coefficients for all range of quantum angular momenta is established.},

	abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

Specifically, the interfacial chemistry of BaF2(111) single-crystal and solid NaCl\{100\} surfaces in contact with ionic liquids such as [BMIM][SCN], [BMIM][DCA], [BMIM][TCM], and [EMIM][TCB] has been investigated. Spectral features in both C?H and C?N stretching regions were assigned, with a detailed discussion of the nature of surface interactions and ordering of the ionic liquid ions at the interface of the different crystals. Results showed that [BMIM]+ cations adhered closely via Coulombic interactions to the negatively charged NaCl\{100\} surface, while [SCN]?, [TCM]?, and [DCA]? anions revealed a strong electrostatic affinity to the positively charged BaF2(111) surface. Ions of the ionic liquid adsorbed to the solid salt surface to form a Helmholtz-like electric double layer. The linear [SCN]? anion has a particularly strong affinity to the BaF2(111) surface, resulting in a first layer of anions directly in contact with BaF2(111) containing an effective negative surface excess charge. This promoted ordering of the cations in the second layer to counter the charge excess. At the BaF2(111)?[EMIM][TCB] interface, however, a strongly bound layer of anions populating the first layer resulted in a much larger counterion charge delivered near the crystal salt surface than required to effectively neutralize the initial surface charge from the crystal. As a result, strong resonances from the cation were observed at the BaF2(111) surface, suggesting a more complicated structure of the double layer at the interface than a simple Helmholtz-type model.},

	abstract = {Water confined in a sol–gel network has been characterized by x-ray and neutron diffraction for two samples of mesoporous silica: one with a hydrophilic character (a nonmodified one) and another with a hydrophobic character (a modified one with a methylated internal pore surface). The pore size has been previously characterized [J.Jelassiet al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.134, 1039 (2010)] to have a mean pore diameter of approximately 55 Å. The diffraction measurements presented in this paper have been made at room temperature [293 K] for a filling factor of 0.45, giving a mean thickness of 8–9 Å for the water layer. The results show that the local order of the confined water molecules in the intermediate region of 3–6 Å is significantly different from that of the bulk water and also for the two different environments. For the hydrophilic sample, the siloxyl groups at the surface modify the water structure through the effects of interfacial hydrogen-bonding, which influences the orientational configuration of local water molecules and creates a modified spatial arrangement in the pore. In the case of the hydrophobic sample, there is no specific interaction with the pore wall, which is primarily van der Waals type, and the water molecules at the interface are differently oriented to create a hydrogen-bonded network linked more directly to the rest of the water volume. In the present circumstances, the thickness of the water layer has a relatively small dimension so that the interpretation of the measured diffraction pattern is not as straightforward as for the bulk liquids, and it is necessary to consider the effects of diffraction-broadening from a distributed sample volume and also the contribution from cross-terms that remain after conducting a “wet-minus-dry” analysis procedure. These analytic difficulties are discussed in the context of the present measurements and compared with the work of other groups engaged in the study of water confined in different environments. The present results, again, emphasize the complexity influencing the properties of water in a confined geometry and the strong influence of surfaceinteractions on its behavior.},

	abstract = {At ambient conditions the intermolecular correlation in liquid water is generally believed to be short ranged as shown in the atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) obtained from scattering experiments or from theoretical predictions. However, atom-atom PDFs provide only a partial description of the higher dimensional intermolecular correlation function that depends on both the positions and orientations of water molecules. Here we study the atomic PDFs of liquid water as well as the angular correlation function (ACF) using a classical density functional theory. We demonstrate that, different from the PDFs, the ACF exhibits long-range oscillatory decay extending up to tens of molecular diameters. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with molecular simulations and corroborate recent experimental results from the second harmonic light scattering experiments.},

Internal strains/stresses upon hydrogen absorption are a crucial factor to understand preferred absorption sites and diffusion. For high concentrations, H absorbs near the octahedral site favoring a large tetragonal distortion of the bcc lattice. For low concentration, H absorbs near the tetrahedral site minimizing the elastic energy stored on nearby cells. Diffusion paths depend on the concentration regime too; hydrogen diffuses about ten times faster in the distorted body-centered-tetragonal (bct) lattice. External stresses of several GPa modify barriers by ≈10\%, and diffusion rates by ≈30\%.},

By using the partial molar volume as a linear empirical correction to the calculated hydration free energy, we obtain predictions of hydration free energies in excellent agreement with experiment (R = 0.94, σ = 0.99 kcal mol − 1 for a test set of 120 organic molecules).},

We attempt to assess the implications of such modulations on the related important quantities and pinpoint the regimes of improved induced streaming potential field and the resulting anisotropy in the induced potential. Our results reveal that for certain combinations of the parameters characterizing the modulated slip, a significant amount of augmentation in the streaming electric field might be obtained, whereas in other cases the effects may lead to adverse consequences. We further demonstrate that the presence of anisotropic modulations on the channel walls give rise to considerable off-diagonal effects, which makes the streaming potential “disoriented” with the applied pressure gradient, when the same is not applied along one of the orthogonal directions. Our analysis also shows that one can remove such “mis-orientations” by finely tuning several relevant flow and geometric parameters, which may bear immense scientific and technological consequences towards an improved design of miniaturized energy conversion devices.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the solubility of NaCl in water is evaluated by using computer simulations for three different force fields. The condition of chemical equilibrium (i.e., equal chemical potential of the salt in the solid and in the solution) is obtained at room temperature and pressure to determine the solubility of the salt. We used the same methodology that was described in our previous work [E. Sanz and C. Vega, J. Chem. Phys. 126, 014507 (2007)] although several modifications were introduced to improve the accuracy of the calculations. It is found that the predictions of the solubility are quite sensitive to the details of the force field used. Certain force fields underestimate the experimental solubility of NaCl in water by a factor of four, whereas the predictions of other force fields are within 20\% of the experimental value. Direct coexistence molecular dynamic simulations were also performed to determine the solubility of the salt. Reasonable agreement was found between the solubility obtained from free energy calculations and that obtained from direct coexistence simulations. This work shows that the evaluation of the solubility of salts in water can now be performed in computer simulations. The solubility depends on the ion-ion, ion-water, and water-water interactions. For this reason, the prediction of the solubility can be quite useful in future work to develop force fields for ions in water.},

The Fe-4Cr alloy exhibits short-range ordering that is antecedent of long-range order, whereas the Fe-16Cr alloy shows short-range ordering that is antecedent of precipitation (clustering). The composition Fe-9Cr lies near the concentration boundary at which the change in the type of short-range ordering occurs.

In a subsequent publication we will describe the hydrophobic hydration and hydrophobic interaction of platelike molecules of nanoscale size. Molecular dynamics is used to compute radial and orientational distribution functions of water around three different molecules:? argon, methane, and neopentane. In addition, the potential of mean force between two neopentane molecules is computed. The results for the full OPLS/AA1 force field are compared with the solute?solvent WCA truncated OPLS/AA force field for these systems. This work addresses the question of whether a molecule of the size of neopentane is large enough to induce a hydrophobic response similar to that of large hydrophobic molecules or paraffin walls. We answer this question in the affirmative. The orientational distribution of water molecules in the first shell neighboring the neopentane molecule is very similar to that near a paraffin wall, in contrast to argon and methane. In addition, the potential of mean force between two neopentane molecules, with the WCA truncated OPLS/AA potential, displays a dewetting-like transition much like that found between two macroscopic hydrophobic objects. We conclude that neopentane defines a length scale for the observation of large-scale hydrophobicity. Smaller molecules fit into a water clathrate, whereas larger molecules force the water to reorganize such that there are dangling OH bonds pointing toward the hydrophobic surface. Large-scale hydrophobicity arises in solute molecules as small as neopentane with diameter (d ≈ 5.2 Å).},

The orientation‐ and distance‐dependent molecular properties of pairs of such molecules are expressed in a standard series form. The terms in these series consist of orthonormal polynomials dependent upon the angle multiplied by arbitrary functions of distance. A number of the arbitrary functions are computed numerically for two modelinteraction energies: the linear Kihara core potential, and a model denoted by the term ``Diatomic\&apos;\&apos; which was obtained by assuming that each molecule consisted of a pair of atomic interaction centers. Changes in the components of the series for the energy are shown for both models as a function of the length of the molecule. Some conclusions are reached concerning the relative importance of the various angle‐dependent terms in the potentials for molecules of a given length. The results obtained for the two models with equivalent values for the parameters are compared, and the adequacy of the spherically symmetric approximation which is often invoked for these functions is discussed.},

	abstract = {While individual water molecules adsorb strongly on a talc surface (hydrophilic behavior), a droplet of water beads up on the same surface (hydrophobic behavior). To rationalize this dichotomy, we investigated the influence of the microscopic structure of the surface and the strength of adhesive (surface?water) interactions on surface hydrophobicity. We have shown that at low relative humidity, the competition between adhesion and the favorable entropy of being in the vapor phase determines the surface coverage. However, at saturation, it is the competition between adhesion and cohesion (water?water interactions) that determines the surface hydrophobicity. The adhesive interactions in talc are strong enough to overcome the unfavorable entropy, and water adsorbs strongly on talc surfaces. However, they are too weak to overcome the cohesive interactions, and water thus beads up on talc surfaces. Surprisingly, even talc-like surfaces that are highly adhesive do not fully wet at saturation. Instead, a water droplet forms on top of a strongly adsorbed monolayer of water. Our results imply that the interior of hydrophobic zeolites suspended in water may contain adsorbed water molecules at pressures much lower than the intrusion pressure.},

Consider for instance the ground state energy and appeal to the description of the system with the aid of Green’s function techniques (Martin and Schwinger, 1959). The ground state energy can be expressed directly in terms of one- and two-particle Green’s functions. The determination of these quantities involves, however, a set of differential equations coupling eventually all n-particle Green’s functions, with n being less than or equal to the number of particles involved. A corresponding statement applies if one frames the problem in the language of the theory of density matrices (ter Haar, 1961).},

The calculations are performed by means of a spin-polarized Green's function technique based on the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbitals method within the atomic sphere approximation. In addition to the conventional paramagnetic and spin-polarized calculations we use the fixed spin-moment method to clarify the effect of magnetism on the surface energies. The results are shown to be consistent with a Friedel model of d-electron bonding combined with spin-split state densities as well as with a Stoner-type description. It is established that the anomaly in the surface energy of the 3d metals deduced from surface tension measurements is purely a magnetic solid state effect. In addition, it is found that magnetism reduces the surface energy of open surfaces, e.g. the (001) crystal faces, to the extent that the usual anisotropy of the surface energy is reversed. Thus a complete realization of the surface energy anomaly only takes place in the less close-packed surface facets.},

The explicit modeling of the solvent and the time length of the simulation allow study of the fast and, to some extent, the slow components of the relaxation. In agreement with experimental studies of the quadrupolar relaxation of monatomic cations in oligomeric DNA solution, the relaxation displays a multiexponential decay. According to the simulation, the slow components originate from ions directly bound to the DNA surface. The effects of the binding of the cations to DNA on the static and dynamical relaxation parameters have been studied in different binding sites either in the grooves or in the backbone. This study reveals that the quadrupolar coupling constant and the spectral densities vary largely from site to site, the fastest relaxation occurring for the ion directly bound to the minor groove. The combination of MD results with quadrupolar relaxation experimental data suggests that the occupancy of the binding sites in the minor groove of uninterrupted adenine sequences is relatively low.},

The electrode pores are modeled as planar graphite sheets and carbon nanotubes with interstices ranging from one to four nanometers. Ordered layers form parallel to the carbon surface, which facilitates focused ion motion under slightly confining conditions. As a result, the ion?s diffusivities are enhanced in the direction of the slit or pore. Further confining the system leads to decreased ion diffusivities. The ions are fully hydrated in all but the smallest slits and pores with those sizes showing increased ion pairing. There is strong evidence of charge separation perpendicular to the surface at all size scales, concentrations, and ion types, providing a useful baseline for examining differential capacitance behavior and future studies on energy storage.

For an accurate description, atom-pairwise dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) was applied. The DFT-D3 scheme was extended non-empirically to improve the description of Ti atoms in bulk systems. New dispersion coefficients were derived from TDDFT calculations for electrostatically embedded TiO(2) clusters. The dispersion coefficient [Formula: see text] is reduced by a factor of 18 compared to the free atom. The three TiO(2) modifications were optimized in periodic plane-wave calculations with dispersion-corrected GGA (PBE, revPBE) and hybrid density functionals (PBE0, revPBE0). The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with experimental data, in particular the dispersion-corrected PBE0 and revPBE0 hybrid functionals. Although the observed relative stabilities could not be reproduced in all cases, dispersion corrections improve the results. For an accurate description of bulk metal oxides, London dispersion is a prominent force that should not be neglected when energies and structures are computed with DFT. Additionally, the influence of dispersion interactions on the relaxation of the TiO(2)(110) surface is investigated.},

For Cs(+) and a series of anions (F(-), Cl(-), Br(-) and I(-)), environmental effects are observed, which reduce the polarizabilities in aqueous solutions with respect to their gas phase values. The polarizabilities of H((aq)) (+), OH((aq)) (-) have also been determined along an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation.

	abstract = {A free energy model for the inhomogeneous hard‐sphere fluid mixture was derived recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 980 (1989)], which is based on the fundamental geometric measures of the particles. Along with an updated assessment of its accuracy, this model is first generalized for charged hard‐sphere fluid mixtures, in which every particle carries a central Yukawa charge, and it is then extended to general fluid mixtures in external fields. The Yukawa‐charged hard‐sphere mixture provides a quite general reference system for many interesting physical systems including plasmas, molten salts, and colloidal dispersions, the screening parameter enabling to interpolate between the long range Coulomb forces and the short range hard cores. A special renormalization property of the Yukawa potential provides the means to derive the exact Onsager‐type lower bound for the potential energy of the mixture, and its related asymptotic strong‐coupling limit of the liquid pair correlation functions. These results are obtained analytically for the general homogeneous mixture with Yukawa interactions. They enable to extend the fundamental measure free energy model to inhomogeneous charged Yukawa mixtures, with the charge contributions given by a truncated second order expansion from the uniform (bulk) fluid limit.The resulting free energy model, which interpolates between the ideal‐gas and ‘‘ideal‐liquid’’ limits, then leads to a self‐consistent method for calculating the density profiles for general fluid mixtures in external fields. This method is equivalent to an ansatz of ‘‘universality of the bridge functional.’’ The ‘‘bridge functional’’ consists of all the terms beyond the second order, in the expansion of the excess free energy functional around a reference uniform fluid. The self‐consistency is imposed by applying the general method in the special case when the external potential is generated by a ‘‘test particle’’ at the origin of coordinates. In this limit, our general method for nonuniform fluids corresponds to an established and successful theory for the bulk uniform fluid pair structure, namely the thermodynamically consistent modified‐hypernetted‐chain theory, with the bridge functions now generated by an explicit and demonstratively accurate, ‘‘universal,’’ hard‐sphere bridge functional. As a stringent test for the general model, the strongly coupled one‐component plasma, in the bulk and near a hard wall, is considered in some detail.},

	abstract = {Magnets composed of molecular species or polymers and prepared by relatively low-temperature organic synthetic methodologies are a focus of contemporary materials science research. The anticipated properties of such molecular-species-based magnetic materials, particularly in combination with other properties associated with molecules and polymers, may enable their use in future generations of electronic, magnetic, and/or photonic/photronic devices ranging from information storage and magnetic imaging to static and low-frequency magnetic shielding. A tutorial of typical magnetic behavior of molecular materials is presented. The three distinct models (intramolecular spin coupling through orthogonal orbitals in the same spatial region within a molecule/ion, intermolecular spin coupling through pairwise “configuration interaction” between spin-containing moieties, and dipole—dipole, through-space interactions) which enable the design of new molecular-based magnetic materials are discussed. To achieve the required spin couplings for bulk ferro- or ferrimagnetic behavior it is crucial to prepare materials with the necessary primary, secondary, and tertiary structures akin to proteins. Selected results from the worldwide effort aimed at preparing molecular-based magnetic materials by these mechanisms are described. Some organometallic solids comprised of linear chains of alternating metallocenium donors (D) and cyanocarbon acceptors (A) that is, …︁D•+ A•− D•+ A•−…︁, exhibit cooperative magnetic phenomena. Bulk ferromagnetic behavior was first observed below the critical (Curie) temperature Tc of 4.8 K for [FeIII(C5Me5)2]•+ [TCNE]•− (Me = methyl; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene). Replacement of FeIII with MnIII leads to a ferromagnet with a Tc of 8.8 K in agreement with mean-field models developed for this class of materials. Replacement with CrIII, however, leads to a ferromagnet with a Tc lowered to 3.65 K which is at variance with this model. Extension to the reaction of a vanadium(o) complex with TCNE leads to the isolation of a magnet with a Tc ≈ 400 K, which exceeds the thermal decomposition temperature of the material. This demonstrates that a magnetic material with a Tc substantially above room temperature is achievable in a molecule/organic/polymeric material. Finally, a new class of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic materials based on metalloporphins is discussed.},

An initialization procedure has been developed which maximizes the Kullback-Leibler entropy and extends the active space in a dynamical fashion. The dynamically extended active space procedure reduces significantly the effective system size during the first half-sweep and accelerates the speed of convergence of momentum space DMRG and quantum chemistry DMRG to a great extent. The effect of lattice site ordering on the number of block states to be kept during the RG procedure is also investigated.},

In-situ STM characterizations reveal the generality of surface etching and micelle-like adsorption of imidazolium cations on Au(100) at potential around the peaks of the bell-shaped feature, demonstrating that the potential of zero charge (PZC) should locate at the potential close to the peaks. Because of the longer side chain length and stronger interaction with Au(100) substrate, an extra capacitance peak appears at the potential as negative as ?1.65 V in OMIPF6 and a corresponding order?disorder transformation of OMI+ cation adlayer is revealed by STM, indicating a correlation between differential capacitance curve and STM.},

	abstract = {The Chemla effect concerns the strong composition dependence of the internal ionic mobilities of cations in mixtures of two molten salts with a common anion, in which the mobility of the large cation can be higher than the small one at low concentrations of the latter. Molecular dynamics simulations of molten ( Li,Cs)NO 3 , ( Li,K)NO 3 , ( Li,Na)NO 3 , ( Na,Cs)NO 3 , each at two different compositions at a given temperature, and also pure LiNO 3 and pure KNO 3 , have been performed with the aim of reproducing the Chemla effect. The key role played by anion polarization on the Chemla effect in molten alkali nitrates is demonstrated by comparing the calculated mobilities using nonpolarizable and polarizable models. Polarization effects were included in the simulations by using a previously proposed fluctuating charge model (FCM) for the NO 3 − anion. It is shown that a single potential model for a ( M 1 , M 2 ) NO 3 mixture gives the correct composition dependence of the M 1 and the M 2 mobilities provided that polarization effects are included in the model. The FCM is thus transferable between different systems, but not its nonpolarizable counterpart. Structure and dynamics of the simulated systems are discussed in light of proposed models for the Chemla effect.},

The new formulation is based on the introduction of average values in the unperturbed state of excitation operators which bear resemblance with analogous ones occurring in the extended Koopmans’ theorem and in the equations-of-motion technique. Such auxiliary quantities, which allow the second-order perturbation contribution to the energy to be evaluated very efficiently, can be calculated at the outset provided the unperturbed four-particle spinless density matrix in the active orbital space is available. A noticeable inequality concerning second-order energy contributions of the same type between the strongly and partially contracted versions is proven to hold. An example concerning the successful calculation of the potential energy curve for the Cr 2 molecule is discussed.},

The exact analytical solution for the ET free energy surfaces demonstrates the following features: (i) the range of ET reaction coordinates is limited by a one-sided fluctuation band, (ii) the ET free energies are infinite outside the band, and (iii) the free energy surfaces are parabolic close to their minima and linear far from the minima positions. The model provides an analytical framework to map physical phenomena conflicting with the Marcus–Hush two-parameter model of ET. Nonlinear solvation, ET in polarizable charge-transfer complexes, and configurational flexibility of donor-acceptor complexes are successfully mapped onto the model. The present theory leads to a significant modification of the energy gap law for ET reactions. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

Geophysical observations indicate that melting beneath ridges begins at depths approaching 300 km, but the cause of this melting has remained unclear. Here we determine the solidus of carbonated peridotite from 3 to 10 GPa and demonstrate that melting beneath ridges may occur at depths up to 330 km, producing 0.03-0.3\% carbonatite liquid. We argue that these melts promote recrystallization and realignment of the mineral matrix, which may explain the geophysical observations. Extraction of incipient carbonatite melts from deep within the oceanic mantle produces an abundant source of metasomatic fluids and a vast mantle residue depleted in highly incompatible elements and fractionated in key parent-daughter elements. We infer that carbon, helium, argon and highly incompatible heat-producing elements (such as uranium, thorium and potassium) are efficiently scavenged from depths of approximately 200-330 km in the upper mantle.},

It is found that 1) SWCNTs-based supercapacitors exhibit a near-flat capacitance-potential curve, 2) the capacitance increases as the tube radius decreases, and 3) the capacitance depends little on the temperature. We report the first MD study showing the limited influence of the electrode curvature on the capacitance-potential curve and negligible dependence of temperature on capacitance of tubular electrode. The latter is in good agreement with recent experimental findings and is attributed to the similarity of the electrical double layer (EDL) microstructure with temperature varying from 260 to 400 K. The electrode curvature effect is explained by the dominance of charge overscreening and increased ion density per unit area of electrode surface.},

The time scales required mean that ab initio MD is prohibitively expensive. Yet the sensitivity of chemical shifts to structural details requires that the methodologies for performing MD and calculating NMR shifts be consistent. This work resolves these previously competing requirements by fitting classical force fields to reproduce ab initio forces. This methodology is first validated by reproducing the averaged chemical shifts found using ab initio molecular dynamics. Study of a supercell of L-alanine demonstrates that finite size effects can be significant when accounting for dynamics.},

It is found that the free energy dependence upon the reaction coordinate of the ion?water complex maintains similar features in ambient and supercritical water, in contrast with related activated processes such as ion pair association. The activation free energy increases with decreasing density (with an inflection point ca. 0.3 g/cm3) although it does not parallel the strong decrease in dielectric constant that takes place, at variance with continuum theory. The substantial increase in exchange rate from ambient to supercritical conditions cannot be simply ascribed to the temperature difference, but to an interplay of temperature and thermodynamic state dependence of the activation free energy, while the dynamic features of the exchange are substantially independent of bulk properties. The present system provides a first computational test of Transition State Theory in supercritical fluids, showing that it overestimates the rate constant by approximately a factor of 2, being slightly more successful than in ambient water.},

	abstract = {The research on electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, is quickly expanding because their power delivery performance fills the gap between dielectric capacitors and traditional batteries. However, many fundamental questions, such as the relations between the pore size of carbon electrodes, ion size of the electrolyte, and the capacitance have not yet been fully answered. We show that the pore size leading to the maximum double-layer capacitance of a TiC-derived carbon electrode in a solvent-free ethyl-methylimmidazolium-bis(trifluoro-methane-sulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) ionic liquid is roughly equal to the ion size (?0.7 nm). The capacitance values of TiC?CDC produced at 500 °C are more than 160 F/g and 85 F/cm3 at 60 °C, while standard activated carbons with larger pores and a broader pore size distribution present capacitance values lower than 100 F/g and 50 F/cm3 in ionic liquids. A significant drop in capacitance has been observed in pores that were larger or smaller than the ion size by just an angstrom, suggesting that the pore size must be tuned with sub-angstrom accuracy when selecting a carbon/ion couple. This work suggests a general approach to EDLC design leading to the maximum energy density, which has been now proved for both solvated organic salts and solvent-free liquid electrolytes.},

	abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N 2 molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10 15 with very modest computational resources.},

Phys. 2004, 121, 10935 ) is extended to include approximate triple excitations via a coupled-cluster with single, double, and triple excitation method (CCSDT-3). The triples contribution can potentially be embedded in a larger singles and doubles region. NLSCC exploits the extensivity of the CC wave function to represent it in terms of transferable natural localized molecular orbitals (NLMOs) or functional groups thereof that are obtained from small quantum mechanical (QM) regions. Both occupied and virtual NLMOs are local because they derive from the single-particle density matrix. Noncanonical triples amplitudes are avoided by applying the unitary localization matrix to the canonical CC wave function for a QM region. A generalized NLMO code interfaced to the ACES II quantum chemistry software package provides NLMOs for the relevant number of atoms in a given functional group. Applications include linear polyglycine and the pentapeptide met-enkephalin, which was chosen as a more realistic three-dimensional system with nontrivial side chains. The results show that the triples contributions are quite large for aromatic bonds suggesting an interesting active space method for triples in which different bonds require different excitation levels. The NLSCC approach recovers a very large percentage ({\textgreater}99\%) of the CCSD or CCSDT-3 correlation energy.},

On top of rapid and sensitive detection, the technique is also shown capable of extracting kinetics data from statistics of the residence time of the binding reaction in equilibrium, that is, without following neither the rate of binding upon injection nor release upon rinsing. The potential of this feature is demonstrated by discriminating a single mismatch from a fully complementary sequence. The success of the method is critically dependent on a surface modification that provides sufficiently low background. This was achieved through self-assembly of a biotinylated copolymer, Poly(L-lysine)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) on a silicon dioxide surface, followed by subsequent addition of streptavidin and biotinylated DNA. The proposed detection scheme is particularly appealing due to the simplicity of the sensor, which relies on self-assembly principles and conventional TIRFM.

In experimental studies it is usually assumed that the deuteron quadrupolar relaxation is governed largely by the reorientational motion of an average electric field gradient, and the error in this assumption is readily extracted from the model calculations. As expected, this error is significant for deuterons in hydrogen bonds.

Extensive molecular dynamics simulations are performed to identify underlying mechanisms of the dynamical transition that corresponds to the onset of amplified atomic fluctuations in proteins. The results indicate that the number of water molecules within a cutoff distance of each residue scales linearly with protein depth index and is not affected by the local dynamics of the backbone. Keeping track of the water molecules within the cutoff sphere, we observe an effective residence time, scaling inversely with depth index at physiological temperatures while the diffusive escape is highly reduced below the transition. A depth independent orientational memory loss is obtained for the average dipole vector of the water molecules within the sphere when the protein is functional. While below the transition temperature, the solvent is in a glassy state, acting as a solid crust around the protein, inhibiting any large scale conformational fluctuations. At the transition, most of the hydration shell unfreezes and water molecules collectively make the protein more flexible.},

We have investigated the structure and electronic properties of clean and adsorbate-covered Cr(100) surfaces using first-principles density-functional calculations. The large outward relaxation observed on adsorption of C, N, or O is shown to be due to the depletion of bonding orbitals of the substrate caused by electron donation to the adsorbate. With an increasing number of p electrons of the adsorbed atom, back-donation effects lead to an incipient filling of antibonding in-plane orbitals of the substrate. For O:Cr(100) this effect is strong enough to promote the formation of surface vacancies.},

	abstract = {The selective rate of specific ion transport across nanoporous material is critical to biological and nanofluidic systems. Molecular sieves for ions can be achieved by steric and electrical effects. However, the radii of Na(+) and K(+) are quite similar; they both carry a positive charge, making them difficult to separate. Biological ionic channels contain precisely arranged arrays of amino acids that can efficiently recognize and guide the passage of K(+) or Na(+) across the cell membrane. However, the design of inorganic channels with novel recognition mechanisms that control the ionic selectivity remains a challenge. We present here a design for a controllable ion-selective nanopore (molecular sieve) based on a single-walled carbon nanotube with specially arranged carbonyl oxygen atoms modified inside the nanopore, which was inspired by the structure of potassium channels in membrane spanning proteins (e.g., KcsA). Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the remarkable selectivity is attributed to the hydration structure of Na(+) or K(+) confined in the nanochannels, which can be precisely tuned by different patterns of the carbonyl oxygen atoms. The results also suggest that a confined environment plays a dominant role in the selectivity process. These studies provide a better understanding of the mechanism of ionic selectivity in the KcsA channel and possible technical applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology, including serving as a laboratory-in-nanotube for special chemical interactions and as a high-efficiency nanodevice for purification or desalination of sea and brackish water.},

This enhancement has been traditionally attributed in experimental studies to the effect of confinement of the ions from the electrolyte inside sub-nanometre pores, which is accompanied by their partial desolvation. Here we perform molecular dynamics simulations of realistic supercapacitors and show that this picture is correct at the microscopic scale. We provide a detailed analysis of the various environments experienced by the ions. We pick out four different adsorption types, and we, respectively, label them as edge, planar, hollow and pocket sites upon increase of the coordination of the molecular species by carbon atoms from the electrode. We show that both the desolvation and the local charge stored on the electrode increase with the degree of confinement.},

	abstract = {Trehalose has been described to act as the best stabilizer of structure and function of several macromolecules. Although other sugars also stabilize macromolecules, none of them are as effective as trehalose. The extraordinary effect of trehalose has been attributed to several of its properties such as making hydrogen bonds with membranes or the ability to modify the solvation layer of proteins. However, the explanations always result in a question: Why is trehalose more effective than other sugars? Here, we show that trehalose has a larger hydrated volume than other related sugars. According to our results, trehalose occupies at least 2.5 times larger volume than sucrose, maltose, glucose, and fructose. We correlate this property with the ability to protect the structure and function of enzymes against thermal inactivation. When the concentrations of all sugars were corrected by the percentage of the occupied volume, they presented the same effectiveness. Our results suggest that because of this larger hydrated volume, trehalose can substitute more water molecules in the solution, and this property is very close to its effectiveness. Finally, these data drive us to conclude that the higher size exclusion effect is responsible for the difference in efficiency of protection against thermal inactivation of enzymes.},

	abstract = {The self-diffusion coefficient of a tagged molecule is known to exhibit a weak mass dependence, especially for solutes with size comparable to or larger than the size of the solvent molecules. Sometimes this mass dependence can be fitted to a power law, with a small exponent, less than 0.1. This weak mass dependence has often been considered as supportive of the hydrodynamic picture (that is, the Stokes-Einstein relation) of diffusion rather than the kinetic theory approach, which predicts a stronger mass dependence, for example, via the Enskog theory. Neither can explain the weak power-law mass dependence. In order to understand this, we have carried out a mode coupling theory (MCT) analysis of diffusion. It is found that a straightforward application of the existing mode coupling theory expressions lead to an inaccurate mass dependence—it predicts an increase of diffusion coefficient with an increase of the mass. We find that this is because of the inadequate description of the initial decay of the collective contributions to the friction. We have proposed a new prescription to accurately describe the short time dynamics of the density and the current term. In addition, we have modified the existing MCT by imposing the full self-consistency between the frequency-dependent friction and the mean square displacement over the whole time and frequency plane. Previously the self-consistency was performed only at the zero frequency level between the zero frequency friction and the diffusion coefficient. With these two generalizations, the mode coupling theory is found to provide a fairly accurate description of the mass dependence. In particular, the theory can correctly reproduce the power-law dependence of solvent-solute diffusion ratio on solute-solvent mass ratio, observed in computer simulations of Bearman and Jolly [Mol. Phys. 44, 665 (1981)]. Another important result is that the current mode is found to play no significant role in determining the diffusion. Thus the hydrodynamic argument of weak mass dependence has little validity for same size solute-solvent systems.},

This viscoelasticity can give rise to long-lived oscillations in the solvation energy which arise primarily from the dipolar excitations (or dipolarons). A non-Markovian theory of solvent dynamics with the inertial and the viscoelastic effects included is used to study the solvation dynamics of an ion. Numerical studies reveal rich relaxation behavior, such as pronounced short-time oscillations followed by a slow long-time decay. It is argued that in the recent computer simulations of soivation in acetonitrile this long wavelength colleciive excitation is essentially observed; the molecular length scale contributions appear as a slow long-time decay. In the presence of a sizeable translational contribution, excitations with wavelengths comparable to the molecular diameter can also be long lived because of the viscoelasticity in the solvent response.},

The fundamental quantity that implicit models seek to approximate is the solute potential of mean force, which determines the statistical weight of solute conformations, and which is obtained by averaging over the solvent degrees of freedom. It is possible to express the total free energy as the reversible work performed in two successive steps. First, the solute is inserted in the solvent with zero atomic partial charges; second, the atomic partial charges of the solute are switched from zero to their full values. Consequently, the total solvation free energy corresponds to a sum of non-polar and electrostatic contributions. These two contributions are often approximated by simple geometrical models (such as solvent exposed area models) and by macroscopic continuum electrostatics, respectively. One powerful route is to approximate the average solvent density distribution around the solute, i.e. the solute–solvent density correlation functions, as in statistical mechanical integral equations. Recent progress with semi-analytical approximations makes continuum electrostatics treatments very efficient. Still more efficient are fully empirical, knowledge-based models, whose relation to explicit solvent treatments is not fully resolved, however. Continuum models that treat both solute and solvent as dielectric continua are also discussed, and the relation between the solute fluctuations and its macroscopic dielectric constant(s) clarified.},

	abstract = {To what extent can a “bottom-up” mesoscale fluid model developed through systematic coarse-graining techniques recover the physical properties of a molecular scale system? In a previous paper [C.-C. Fu, P. M. Kulkarni, M. S. Shell, and L. G. Leal, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 164106 (2012)]10.1063/1.4759463, we addressed this question for thermodynamic properties through the development of coarse-grained (CG) fluid models using modified iterative Boltzmann inversion methods that reproduce correct pair structure and pressure. In the present work we focus on the dynamic behavior. Unlike the radial distribution function and the pressure, dynamical properties such as the self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity in a CG model cannot be matched during coarse-graining by modifying the pair interaction. Instead, removed degrees of freedom require a modification of the equations of motion to simulate their implicit effects on dynamics. A simple but approximate approach is to introduce a friction coefficient, γ, and random forces for the remaining degrees of freedom, in which case γ becomes an additional parameter in the coarse-grained model that can be tuned. We consider the non-Galilean-invariant Langevin and the Galilean-invariant dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats with CG systems in which we can systematically tune the fraction ϕ of removed degrees of freedom. Between these two choices, only DPD allows both the viscosity and diffusivity to match a reference Lennard-Jones liquid with a single value of γ for each degree of coarse-graining ϕ. This friction constant is robust to the pressure correction imposed on the effective CG potential, increases approximately linearly with ϕ, and also depends on the interaction cutoff length, rcut, of the pair interaction potential. Importantly, we show that the diffusion constant and viscosity are constrained by a simple scaling law that leads to a specific choice of DPD friction coefficient for a given degree of coarse-graining. Moreover, we find that the pair interaction distance cutoffs used for DPD random and dissipative forces should be considered separately from that of the conservative interaction potential.},

	abstract = {The collective dynamics in a binary mixture of colloidal particles which are driven in opposite directions by an external oscillatory field is examined by computer simulations in two spatial dimensions. Both Brownian dynamics (BD) computer simulations, which ignore solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions between the colloidal particles, and multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD) simulations, which include hydrodynamic interactions, are employed. We first review recent results obtained by BD. Depending on the driving frequency and amplitude, lane formation parallel to the drive and band formation perpendicular to the drive occur. Band formation is stable only in a finite window of oscillation frequencies and driving strengths and is taken over by lane formation if the driving force is increased or the oscillation frequency is decreased. MPCD simulations, on the other hand, reveal that band formation is blurred by hydrodynamic interactions. During the front collisions of oppositely driven particles there is a strong vortical movement of the solvent which tends to mix particles and broaden the interface of the bands. This can either lead to a novel intermittent dynamical behaviour or to band rupture into local clusters. These effects, which are absent for BD, are characterized by the strengths of the enstrophy and its spectrum. We finally discuss possible experimental realizations of the models employed.},

An important conclusion reached in this study is the good transferability of the potential from felsic to ultramafic compositions although this transferability becomes less accurate with high silica contents (rhyolitic composition and beyond) and with very iron-rich silicates (e.g. fayalite). A key feature of the simulation is to make the link between macroscopic properties of the melt and its microscopic structure and dynamics. We thus obtain a relationship between the molar volume of the melt, the number of network modifiers and the oxygen coordination number. The simulation also allows one to quantify the coordination environment around the cations as function of the melt composition. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the high temperature liquid is investigated.},

	abstract = {Lithium titanium oxide Li[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4 (LTO) is regarded as an ideal electrode material for lithium-ion batteries because of its ?zero-strain? characteristic, high thermal stability, and structural stability. Here, the zero-strain means that the change in cubic lattice parameter is negligibly small during charge and discharge reactions. We performed ex situ Raman spectroscopy on Li1+x[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4 samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.94 to gain information about the relationship between a zero-strain reaction scheme and structural change at the atomic scale. The x = 0 (initial) sample exhibits three major Raman bands at 671, 426, and 231 cm?1 and six minor Raman bands at 751, 510, 400, 344, 264, and 146 cm?1. According to Raman spectroscopy results on other lithium titanium oxides such as Li2TiO3 and TiO2, the Raman bands at 510, 400, and 146 cm?1 are attributed to TiO2 anatase, which is used as a starting material. As x increases from 0 to 0.94, the two major Raman bands at 426 and 231 cm?1 show a blue shift, while the major Raman band at 671 cm?1 maintains frequency. The three major Raman bands at 671, 423, and 231 cm?1 are assigned to the A1g mode of symmetric stretching vibration ?sym(Ti?O), the Eg mode of asymmetric stretching vibration ?asym(Li?O), and the F2g mode of bending vibration δ(Ti?O), respectively. Thus, the change in the Raman spectrum with x indicates that the bond length between the Ti and O atoms in the TiO6 octahedron is independent of x, while that between the Li and O atoms in the LiO6 octahedron and the bond angle between the Ti and O atoms in the TiO6 octahedron change with x. Raman studies with decreasing x from 0.94 to 0.10 clarified that such local structural changes are reversible, as in the case for the electrochemical reaction. The zero-strain insertion scheme is discussed from the perspective of Raman spectroscopy.},

Here we present a theoretical model for the description of a generic aggregate formed from an ensemble of charged proteins. The model predicts the formation of multifractal structures with the geometry of the growth determined by the electrostatic interactions between single proteins. The model predictions are successfully verified in comparison with experimental curves for aggregate growth allowing us to reveal the mechanism of formation of such complex structures. The model is general and is able to predict aggregate morphologies occurring both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provide a framework where the physical interactions between single proteins, the aggregate morphology, and the growth kinetics are connected into a single model in agreement with the experimental data.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of an electric field on a highly charged polyelectrolyte (PE) chain by Brownian-dynamics simulation methods and a combination of different scaling arguments. In the simulation we take the counterions explicitly into account and therefore include the effects of counterion condensation and PE collapse as the coupling parameter (proportional to counterion valency) is increased. For highly charged PEs in the collapsed phase, a nonequilibrium unfolding transition occurs at sufficiently high electric fields where the PE aligns parallel to the external field. The critical field strength E* is determined from scaling results for the polarizability of a PE globule and exhibits a dependence on the chain length N, E* ? N-1/2, which might be useful for electrophoretic separation of charged, collapsed biopolymers. For noncollapsed PEs this unfolding transition is less pronounced:? the critical field depends on the swelling exponent ? and scales as E* ? N-3?/2. The electrophoretic mobility of PE monomers and counterions is determined. For large fields, counterions bound to the PE contribute significantly to the total conduction, since they can glide along the PE. This is an important factor in understanding experimental conduction experiments. The electrophoretic mobility of the bound counterions is determined by the electrostatic friction with the PE backbone and an activation barrier for decondensing from the PE; it in fact changes sign as the field strength is increased.},

Using projection operators and second quantization algebra, an operator is constructed which consists of the complete active space Hamiltonian in the active space and the Mo/ller–Plesset zeroth‐order Hamiltonian in the inactive and secondary spaces. This operator, designated CAS/A, has the reference as an eigenfunction without the necessity of projection, it naturally incorporates denominator shifts which appear in terms of active space Fock operators, it does not give rise to intruder states, and it costs little more than other CASSCF perturbation theories. The incorporation of the complete active space Hamiltonian introduces additional active space two‐particle terms into the zeroth‐order energies over the Fock operators, which may be regarded as an inconsistency. To achieve an approximate consistency, they may be removed or supplemented with other particle–particle and hole–hole terms. The results of test calculations indicate that supplementation is not advisable and that removal has only a modest effect. The test calculations are compared with other results and experiment, and support the effectiveness of the proposed CAS/A Ĥ0.},

	abstract = {Composite materials composed of aluminosilicate clays with organic molecules or biomolecules in the interlayer galleries are readily synthesized and have many applications in agriculture, medicine, environmental science, engineering, and geochemistry. Detailed characterization of the molecular-scale structure and dynamics of the interlayer galleries is difficult experimentally because of static and dynamic disorder but can be obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using classical force fields. This Article presents an MD study of smectite clay montmorillonite (MMT) intercalated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with and without CO2 also present in the interlayer. Bulk PEG can incorporate large amounts of CO2 under supercritical conditions, and MMT?PEG composites have potential as gas-separation materials. The MD simulations of anhydrous MMT containing interlayer CO2 (MMT?CO2), PEG (MMT?PEG), and PEG + CO2 (MMT?PEG?CO2) provide new atomic-level insight into the molecular ordering of CO2 near the basal surface and CO2-induced changes in the structure, conformation, and energetics of PEG in the interlayer. The results show that the structural arrangement among the CO2 molecules in the MMT?CO2 system is similar to that in supercritical CO2 and is analogous to that of crystalline CO2. All Na ions in this system remain coordinated by the basal oxygens (Ob) but are also coordinated by the oxygens (OCO2) of the CO2 molecules, and a few are displaced ?2 Å above their surface sites. The cooperative motion of the Na ions and CO2 molecules increases the Na diffusion and the CO2 reorientation in the interlayers. The critical interactions among cations, CO2, PEG, and the basal surface in the MMT?PEG?CO2 system result in a layer of CO2 trapped between the basal surface and cation-permeable PEG film formed on the basal surface. In the MMT?PEG and MMT?PEG?CO2 systems, PEG is highly disordered and exhibits conformational and orientational heterogeneity in the interlayer confinement with many of the molecules lying in a layer parallel and close to the basal surface of the clay. Some of the PEG molecules span from one basal surface to the other across the interlayer. Many of the Na ions are displaced from the basal surface and are coordinated by both basal oxygens and oxygens of the PEG. Some are completely displaced from the surface and are dissolved in the PEG. In the MMT?PEG?CO2 system, the CO2 molecules occur in well-defined layers parallel to the basal surface and are most commonly dissolved in the PEG. In the full MMT?PEG?CO2 system, Na ions have few OCO2 nearest neighbors, and the presence of CO2 causes the basal spacing to expand but does not change the conformation of the PEG. The MD results provide detailed and otherwise unobtainable information about the coordination environments and distributions of interatomic distances and angles in the interlayer.},

The authors show how all these results can be understood in a unified way in terms of a general theorem published earlier. The argument applies quite generally to any set of tight-binding bands such as the d bands, independent of the specific structure. In a general sense the superlattice formation for approximately a half-filled band is like a Peierls transition, but it results from the electronic structure as a whole with no special role attached to the Fermi surface. The case of threefold superlattices is also discussed with examples.},

We found that a mixture of 5\% glycerol and 95\% trehalose has the most suppressed short time dynamics (fast dynamics). This result agrees with the experimental analysis of the mean-square displacement of the hydrogen atoms, as measured via neutron scattering, and correlates with the experimentally observed enhancement of the stability of some enzymes at this particular concentration. Our microscopic analysis suggests that the formation of a robust intermolecular hydrogen bonding network is most effective at this concentration and is the main mechanism for the suppression of the fast dynamics.},

In the saturated Cd cathode, the An and RE elements were recovered forming a PuCd11 type compound, MCd11 (M = An and RE elements). The separation factors of element M against Pu defined as [M/Pu in Cd alloy (cathode)]/[M/Pu in molten salt] were calculated for the saturated Cd cathode including MCd11. The separation factors were 0.011, 0.044, 0.064, and 0.064 for La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, respectively. These values were a little differed from 0.014, 0.038, 0.044, and 0.043 for the equilibrium unsaturated liquid Cd, respectively. The above slight differences were considered to be caused by the solid phase formation in the saturated Cd cathode and the electrochemical transfer of the An and RE elements in the molten salt.},

	abstract = {Short-range order (SRO) in Fe-rich Fe-Cr alloys is investigated by means of atomistic off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations in the semi-grand-canonical ensemble using classical interatomic potentials. The SRO parameter defined by Cowley [Phys. Rev. 77, 669 (1950)] is used to quantify the degree of ordering. In agreement with experiments a strong ordering tendency in the Cr distribution at low Cr concentrations (≲5\%) is observed, as manifested in negative values of the SRO parameters. For intermediate Cr concentrations (5\%≲cCr≲15\%), the SRO parameter for the α phase goes through a minimum, but at the solubility limit, the α-phase still displays a rather strong SRO. In thermodynamic equilibrium for concentrations within the two-phase region the SRO parameter measured over the entire sample therefore comprises the contributions from both the α and α′ phases. If both of these contributions are taken into account, it is possible to quantitatively reproduce the experimental results and interpret their physical implications. It is thereby shown that the inversion of the SRO observed experimentally is due to the formation of stable (supercritical) α′ precipitates. It is not related to the loss of SRO in the α phase or to the presence of unstable (subcritical) Cr precipitates in the α phase.},

With no adjustable parameters, theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulation data for the density distributions and for the adsorption isotherms of hard-sphere chains near hard walls or in slit-like pores. This theory is applied to calculate the force between two parallel hard walls separated by hard-sphere chains at different densities. Calculated results indicate that the chain-mediated force is attractive and decays monotonically with separation at low chain densities, it oscillates at high chain densities and in between, it is attractive at small separation and repulsive at large separation. This new density functional theory is simpler than similar theories in the literature and is directly applicable to mixtures. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Continuum mean-field models that have been carefully designed to address the various electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions that develop between a molecule and a surrounding medium are particularly efficient tools for studying the effects of condensed phases on molecular structure, energetics, properties, spectra, interaction potentials, and dynamics. The SM8 model may be combined with density functional theory or Hartree-Fock theory to describe a solute's electronic structure and its self-consistent-field polarization by a solvent. A key feature is the use of class IV charge models to obtain accurate charge distributions (either in the vapor phase or in solution), even when using small basis sets that are affordable for large systems. A second key feature is that nonelectrostatic effects due to cavity formation, dispersion interactions, and changes in solvent structure are included in terms of empirical atomic surface tensions that depend on geometry but do not require atom-type assignments by the user. Use of an analytic surface area algorithm provides very stable energy gradients that allow geometry optimization in solution. The SM8 continuum model, the culmination of a series of SMx models (x = 1-8), permits the modeling of such diverse media as aqueous and organic solvents, soils, lipid bilayers, and air-water interfaces. In addition to predicting accurate transfer free energies between gaseous and condensed phases or between two different condensed phases, SMx models have been useful for predicting the significant influence of condensed phases on processes associated with a change in molecular charge, including acid/base equilibria and oxidation/reduction processes. In this Account, we provide an overview of the algorithms associated with the computation of free energies of solvation in the SM8 model. We also compare the accuracies of the SM8 model with those of other continuum solvation models. Finally, we highlight applications of the SM8 models to compute ionic solvation free energies, oxidation and reduction potentials, and pK(a) values.},

The same approach will be followed for transport properties. The fundamental aspects of conduction regimes and transport length scales will be presented using simple models of disorder, with the derivation of a few analytic results concerning specific situations of short- and long-range static perturbations. Further, the latest developments in semiempirical or ab initio simulations aimed at exploring the effect of realistic static scatterers (chemical impurities, adsorbed molecules, etc.) or inelastic electron-phonon interactions will be emphasized. Finally, specific issues, going beyond the noninteracting electron model, will be addressed, including excitonic effects in optical experiments, the Coulomb-blockade regime, and the Luttinger liquid, charge density waves, or superconducting transition.},

	abstract = {In contrast to crystalline solids--for which a precise framework exists for describing structure--quantifying structural order in liquids and glasses has proved more difficult because even though such systems possess short-range order, they lack long-range crystalline order. Some progress has been made using model systems of hard spheres, but it remains difficult to describe accurately liquids such as water, where directional attractions (hydrogen bonds) combine with short-range repulsions to determine the relative orientation of neighbouring molecules as well as their instantaneous separation. This difficulty is particularly relevant when discussing the anomalous kinetic and thermodynamic properties of water, which have long been interpreted qualitatively in terms of underlying structural causes. Here we attempt to gain a quantitative understanding of these structure-property relationships through the study of translational and orientational order in a models of water. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a structurally anomalous region--bounded by loci of maximum orientational order (at low densities) and minimum translational order (at high densities)--in which order decreases on compression, and where orientational and translational order are strongly coupled. This region encloses the entire range of temperatures and densities for which the anomalous diffusivity and thermal expansion coefficient of water are observed, and enables us to quantify the degree of structural order needed for these anomalies to occur. We also find that these structural, kinetic and thermodynamic anomalies constitute a cascade: they occur consecutively as the degree of order is increased.},

	abstract = {A classical density functional theory is applied to study solvation of solutes in water. An approx- imate form of the excess functional is proposed for water. This functional requires the knowledge of pure solvent direct correlation functions. Those functions can be computed by using molecular simulations such as molecular dynamic or Monte Carlo. It is also possible to use functions that have been determined experimentally. The functional minimization gives access to the solvation free energy and to the equilibrium solvent density. Some correction to the functional are also proposed to get the proper tetrahedral order of solvent molecules around a charged solute and to reproduce the correct long range hydrophobic behavior of big apolar solutes. To proceed the numerical minimization of the functional, the theory has been discretized on two tridimensional grids, one for the space coordinates, the other for the angular coordinates, in a functional minimization code written in modern Fortran, mdft. This program is used to study the solvation in water of small solutes of several kind, atomic and molecular, charged or neutral. More complex solutes, a neutral clay and a small protein have also been studied by functional minimization. In each case the classical density functional theory is able to reproduce the exact results predicted by MD. The computational cost is at least three order of magnitude less than in explicit methods.},

	abstract = {A general method for obtaining effective normal modes of a molecular system from molecular dynamics simulations is presented. The method is based on a localization criterion for the Fourier transformed velocity time-correlation functions of the effective modes. For a given choice of the localization function used, the method becomes equivalent to the principal mode analysis (PMA) based on covariance matrix diagonalization. On the other hand, a proper choice of the localization function leads to a novel method with a strong analogy with the usual normal modeanalysis of equilibrium structures, where the Hessian system at the minimum energy structure is replaced by the thermal averaged Hessian, although the Hessian itself is never actually calculated. This method does not introduce any extra numerical cost during the simulation and bears the same simplicity as PMA itself. It can thus be readily applied to ab initiomolecular dynamics simulations. Three such examples are provided here. First we recover effective normal modes of an isolated formaldehyde molecule computed at 20 K in very good agreement with the results of a normal modeanalysis performed at its equilibrium structure. We then illustrate the applicability of the method for liquid phase studies. The effective normal modes of a water molecule in liquid water and of a uracil molecule in aqueous solution can be extracted from ab initiomolecular dynamics simulations of these two systems at 300 K .},

Multiscale numerical modeling (Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics, and Brownian dynamics) was used to quantify the importance of the various relaxation mechanisms likely to be responsible for the NMR relaxation of the water molecules within such complex environment. Because of the significant fraction of iron present in these natural clays, the large value of the transverse relaxation rate measured for the confined water molecules is compatible with a dominant paramagnetic coupling modulated by the long-range diffusion of water molecules. Finally, the angular variation of the apparent relaxation rate can be used to extract the distribution of the directors of the clay lamellae within the self-supporting film.},

The calculated structural properties show that water and sodium cations behave in the same way as in pure homoionic Na-montmorillonites. The study of the dynamical properties shows that simulated self-diffusion coefficients of water are in agreement with short time coefficients measured by neutron scattering. For the ions, the experimental values are related to macroscopic long-time motion and are not directly comparable to simulations. However, the introduction of simulated values in macroscopic models gives results in agreement with tracer experiments.},

	abstract = {It has been previously established on the basis of an Ising model of alloy ordering (part I of this series) that the observed maxima of short-range-order diffuse scattering in disordered alloys mark the positions of the minima of V(k), the Fourier transform of the pairwise interatomic potential V(r). It was suggested in I that the superlattice spots of the ordered state should occur at these same positions. This would establish a consistency requirement connecting the ordered and disordered configurations. We prove here that this is a sufficient but not a necessary condition, and we derive the full set of necessary conditions. We also show that for most of the diffuse maxima locations observed in bcc and fcc alloys, it is possible to establish the ordered configuration required by the disordered phase, or conversely to use a knowledge of the ordered configuration to restrict the possible choices of V(r) in fitting the disordered-phase scattering data. The linear approximation for correlation functions in binary alloys presented by the authors in I is compared quantitatively with the more exact but less general formula of Fisher and Burford. Except at temperatures very close to Tc, it is found that the theoretical shape of the short-range order diffuse scattering is in agreement but the temperature dependencies differ. We note also that all the currently known approximate calculations of α(k) for arbitrary V(r) can be represented in the same functional form, α(k)=G2(T)/[1+G1(T)V(k)], where the temperature-dependent factors G1 and G2 vary according to the method of calculation used, but that V(k), the Fourier transform of V(r), is the same for all. This leads to the conclusion that the ratios V(rn+1)/V(rn) determined by fitting the theoretical form to experimental data are insensitive to the particular choice of G1 and G2, but that the magnitudes of the V(rn) so determined vary according to this choice. As a consequence, the values obtained for V(rn+1)/V(rn) are to be regarded as more accurate than those for V(rn).},

Swelling clay minerals, such as the smectite variety, possess an aluminosilicate structure that is controlled by low-charge layers that readily expand to accommodate water molecules and, potentially, CO2. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intercalating CO2 in the interlayer of layered clays, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the process and the extent of carbon capture as a function of clay charge and structure. A series of molecular dynamics simulations and vibrational analyses have been completed to assess the molecular interactions associated with incorporation of CO2 and H2O in the interlayer of montmorillonite clay and to help validate the models with experimental observation. An accurate and fully flexible set of interatomic potentials for CO2 is developed and combined with Clayff potentials to help evaluate the intercalation mechanism and examine the effect of molecular flexibility on the diffusion rate of CO2 in water.},

	abstract = {Equations of state have been derived for one, two and three-dimensional gases of hard elastic spheres of finite size. For the linear gas the phase integral is directly integrable, and by using the virial the equation was found to be fl=NkT(1−θ), f being the force of the gas, l the length of the gas, N the total number of atoms, and θ the fraction of the gas length occupied by the atoms themselves. By two tests a linear gas consisting of a single atom was found on a time average basis to obey statistical laws, the first showing that the equation of state is unchanged if l be subdivided into N equal compartments with an atom in each; and the second showing that the length of the single atom gas consisting of one atom bounded by its two neighbors obeys the Boltzmann equation. This is significant for the Debye-Hückel theory of electrolytes. For the plane gas, Boltzmann's method of correcting the virial is used for low θ, the fraction of the surface which would be covered in close triangular packing, giving τa=NkT(1+1.814θ+2.573θ2+⋯), where τ is the surface tension and a the area of the gas. For θ near unity, a combination treatment involving both the virial and an extension of the concepts developed for one dimension leads to τa=NkT(1−θ12). The adsorption isotherm of the plane gas is derived from the equation of state and is compared with those for films in which the adatoms occupy fixed positions on the surface. In three dimensions the same methods give pv=NkT (1+2.962θ+5.483θ2+⋯) and pv=NkT(1−θ12), respectively. Expressions which match these near θ=0 and θ=1 but cover the complete range are given.},

	abstract = {In order to understand self-diffusion (D) of a charged, flexible, and porous nanoscopic molecule in water, we carry out very long, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of PAMAM dendrimer up to eight generations in explicit salt water under varying pH. We find that while the radius of gyration (Rg) varies as N1/3, the self-diffusion constant (D) scales, surprisingly, as N−α, with α = 0.39 at high pH and 0.5 at neutral pH, indicating a dramatic breakdown of Stokes–Einstein relation for diffusion of charged nanoscopic molecules. The variation in D as a function of radius of gyration demonstrates the importance of treating water and ions explicitly in the diffusion process of a flexible nanoscopic molecule. In agreement with recent experiments, the self-diffusion constant increases with pH, revealing the importance of dielectric friction in the diffusion process. The shape of a dendrimer is found to fluctuate on a nanosecond time scale. We argue that this flexibility (and also the porosity) of the dendrimer may play an important role in determining the mean square displacement of the dendrimer and the breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation between diffusion constant and the radius.},

The analytical first derivatives of the free energy with respect to displacements of the solute nuclear coordinates have also been developed. This enables study of chemical reactions, including reaction coordinates and transition state search, with the molecular solvation described from the first principles. The method yields all of the features available by using other solvation approaches, for instance infrared spectra of solvated molecules. To evaluate the accuracy of the present method, test calculations have been carried out for a number of small molecules, including four glycine conformers, a set of small organic compounds, and carbon nanotubes of various lengths in aqueous solution. Our predictions for the solvation free energy agree well with other approaches as well as experiment. This new development makes it possible to calculate at modest computational cost the electronic properties and molecular solvation structure of a solute molecule in a given molecular liquid or mixture from the first principles.},

The first, based on a cluster expansion Hamiltonian, describes the effects of configurational disorder in an alloy on its thermodynamic properties. Cluster expansion can be used for studying alloys by both equilibrium and kinetic Monte Carlo methods. The second, recently proposed, "magnetic" cluster expansion (MCE) method extends cluster expansion treatment to magnetic degrees of freedom by including magnetic moments of individual atoms as variables. MCE has a unique capability for modelling the properties of a magnetic alloy in a broad range of compositions ranging from pure ferromagnetic Fe to antiferromagnetic Cr. We describe applications of both methods to modelling various properties of candidate fusion materials.},

	abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e. g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.

The best performance is obtained for the basis sets generated according to a new scheme presented here, a flexibilization of previous proposals. Strict localization is maintained while ensuring the continuity of the basis-function derivative at the cutoff radius. The basis sets are tested versus converged plane-wave calculations on a significant variety of systems, including covalent, ionic, and metallic. Satisfactory convergence is obtained for reasonably small basis sizes, with a clear improvement over previous schemes. The transferability of the obtained basis sets is tested in several cases and it is found to be satisfactory as well.},

	abstract = {We validate here the Two-Phase Thermodynamics (2PT) method for calculating the standard molar entropies and heat capacities of common liquids. In 2PT, the thermodynamics of the system is related to the total density of states (DoS), obtained from the Fourier Transform of the velocity autocorrelation function. For liquids this DoS is partitioned into a diffusional component modeled as diffusion of a hard sphere gas plus a solid component for which the DoS(υ) → 0 as υ→ 0 as for a Debye solid. Thermodynamic observables are obtained by integrating the DoS with the appropriate weighting functions. In the 2PT method, two parameters are extracted from the DoS self-consistently to describe diffusional contributions: the fraction of diffusional modes, f, and DoS(0). This allows 2PT to be applied consistently and without re-parameterization to simulations of arbitrary liquids. We find that the absolute entropy of the liquid can be determined accurately from a single short MD trajectory (20 ps) after the system is equilibrated, making it orders of magnitude more efficient than commonly used perturbation and umbrella sampling methods. Here, we present the predicted standard molar entropies for fifteen common solvents evaluated from molecular dynamics simulations using the AMBER, GAFF, OPLS AA/L and Dreiding II forcefields. Overall, we find that all forcefields lead to good agreement with experimental and previous theoretical values for the entropy and very good agreement in the heat capacities. These results validate 2PT as a robust and efficient method for evaluating the thermodynamics of liquid phase systems. Indeed 2PT might provide a practical scheme to improve the intermolecular terms in forcefields by comparing directly to thermodynamic properties.},

	abstract = {Given the typical interaction strength between the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and non-vanishing local, extranuclear field gradients, the electric quadrupole relaxation mechanism is usually dominant for all spin-one or greater nuclei.In general, various quadrupolar relaxation rates can be written in simple, closed form, and features associated with relaxation-induced polarization and coherence transfer are quenched. Such expressions are summarized in the first few sections of this article. Also discussed are consequences associated with the failure of the extreme narrowing approximation that results in multiexponential relaxation.The quadrupolar interaction is traceless and in the motionally narrowed regime, averages to zero. Thus, only line broadening and not line positions are affected. However, the Zeeman and quadrupolar interactions do not commute and second-order (and higher order) corrections may become important. Thus, a discussion of the dynamic frequency shift in quadrupolar spin systems is provided.Finally, it is recognized that efficiently relaxed quadrupolar nuclei influence scalar-coupled spin one-half nuclei. Features associated with this phenomenon are developed in the last section of this article.},

	abstract = {The atomic antishielding factor R for the quadrupole hyperfine structure has been evaluated for the lowest three excited np states for each of the alkali atoms, i.e., for a total of fifteen atomic states. The values of R were determined by means of the perturbed wave functions v1′(nl→l′), as obtained by solving the inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation for each type of excitation of the core electrons by the nuclear quadrupole moment Q. In order to obtain reliable values of R, we have obtained accurate valence wave functions v(np) for the np excited states from the requirement that the calculated energy eigenvalues E0(np) should reproduce the observed energy levels. The wave function v(n0p) for the lowest valence np state (n=n0, e.g., n0=3 for Na) was checked for each alkali atom by calculating the oscillator strength fn0s→n0p for the lowest n0s→np transition. The calculated values of fn0s→n0p were found to be in good agreement with experiment. As an example of the values of R(np) obtained, we have found for Rb: R(5p)=-0.257; R(6p)=-0.207; and R(7p)=-0.190. The resulting correction factors C=1/(1-R) are C(5p)=0.796, C(6p)=0.829, and C(7p)=0.840. At the end of the paper we give the corrected values of Q for twelve alkali isotopes, for which experimental data are available, namely, for the following nuclei: Na23, K39, K40, K41, Rb85, Rb87, Cs131, Cs132, Cs133, Cs134, Cs135, and Cs137.

In the case in which ρ varies in one direction x only, the solution of the Euler–Lagrange differential equation is analyzed in detail. This describes the cases of a single phase and of two coexisting phases and leads to the equal area Maxwell construction. The effect of an external field on the solution is discussed. The Euler–Lagrange differential equation provides a differential statement of Bernoulli’s theorem. In a three dimensional treatment the stress tensor formula is obtained from the corresponding Euler–Lagrange partial differential equation. A (differential) generalization of the Young–Laplace equation for a spherical interface is also derived. In addition, metastable regions are described and interpreted. The stress tensor for a system in the presence of any kind of conservative force field is also obtained.},

At sufficiently long times the particle motion can be coarse-grained and described as effective free-diffusion along the tube axis. In the coarse-grained description all the details of the tube geometry are packed into the effective diffusion coefficient of the particle. We derive a formula for the effective diffusion coefficient, which shows how it depends on the geometric parameters of the tube. To test the accuracy of this formula we compare its predictions with the values of the effective diffusion coefficient found in Brownian dynamics simulations. The comparison shows that the formula is applicable at arbitrary values of the length and radius of the narrow sections on condition that the radius of the wide sections does not exceed their length.},

	abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of transport phenomena in compacted clays is essential for the use of such materials as engineered barrier systems for the safe geological disposal of radioactive wastes. The present contribution is a first step in the development of an integrative treatment of the properties of tracer cations in compacted bentonites with respect to diffusion and sorption. The diffusion of 22Na and 85Sr in highly compacted montmorillonite and kaolinite is investigated as a function of the ?external salt concentration? (NaClO4), i.e., of the solution in equilibrium with the clay. Consistent results were obtained from through-diffusion experiments and tracer profile analysis. Knowledge of genuine diffusion coefficients of the filter plates turned out to be crucial in cases where the diffusive resistance of the filter plates was similar to that of the clay. Diffusion coefficients formally calculated on the basis of the tracer concentration gradient in the external aqueous phase, and the sorption distribution ratios were found to decrease with increasing external salt concentration in the case of montmorillonite. In a logarithmic representation of these data, a slope of ?1 was obtained for the monovalent 22Na, whereas the slope was ?2 for the divalent 85Sr. In the case of kaolinite, diffusion coefficients were independent of the external salt concentration. It is postulated that the diffusion of the tracer cation through the interlayer water is the dominant pathway in compacted swelling clays under the experimental conditions tested. Effective diffusion coefficients, based on a tracer concentration gradient in the interlayer water of the clay, were found to be independent of the composition of the external aqueous phase. The latter gradient is assumed to be a function of the external salt concentration, according to a calculated distribution of the tracer cation between free pore water and the interlayer water via cation exchange.},

	abstract = {In a previous theoretical and simulation study [G. I. Guerrero-García, E. González-Tovar, and M. Olvera de la Cruz, Soft Matter 6, 2056 (2010)], it has been shown that an asymmetric charge neutralization and electrostatic screening depending on the charge polarity of a single nanoparticle occurs in the presence of a size-asymmetric monovalent electrolyte. This effect should also impact the effective potential between two macroions suspended in such a solution. Thus, in this work we study the mean force and the potential of mean force between two identical charged nanoparticles immersed in a size-asymmetric monovalent electrolyte, showing that these results go beyond the standard description provided by the well-known Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory. To include consistently the ion-size effects, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and liquid theory calculations are performed at the McMillan-Mayer level of description in which the solvent is taken into account implicitly as a background continuum with the suitable dielectric constant. Long-range electrostatic interactions are handled properly in the simulations via the well established Ewald sums method and the pre-averaged Ewald sums approach, originally proposed for homogeneous ionic fluids. An asymmetric behavior with respect to the colloidal charge polarity is found for the effective interactions between two identical nanoparticles. In particular, short-range attractions are observed between two equally charged nanoparticles, even though our model does not include specific interactions; these attractions are greatly enhanced for anionic nanoparticles immersed in standard electrolytes where cations are smaller than anions. Practical implications of some of the presented results are also briefly discussed. A good accord between the standard Ewald method and the pre-averaged Ewald approach is attained, despite the fact that the ionic system studied here is certainly inhomogeneous. In general, good agreement between the liquid theory approach and MD simulations is also found.},

The calculated work function for the ferromagnetic state is found to be in excellent agreement with experiment, whereas that calculated for the paramagnetic state is significantly worse (namely, 0.5 eV too large), indicating the importance of spin polarization on this electrostatic property. For both states, partial densities of states (projected by layer and by orbital angular momentum), surface states, and charge (and spin) densities are presented and their differences employed to discuss the origin of surface magnetism. No Friedel oscillation is found in the layer-by-layer charge density. The surface-layer magnetic moment is found to have been increased by 0.73μB from the center layer to 2.98μB/atom; a very small Friedel oscillation is obtained for the spin density, which indicates possible size effects in this seven-layer film. Layer-by-layer Fermi contact hyperfine fields are presented: While the core-polarization contributions are proportional to the magnetic moment, the conduction-electron contribution shows a pronounced Friedel oscillation in the central layer and, significantly, a change of sign and increase in the magnitude for the surface-layer contribution. The hyperfine field at the nucleus of the center-layer atoms is found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. The net result for the surface-layer atoms is a predicted decrease in magnitude of the total Fermi contact hyperfine field despite the large increase of their magnetic moments. The relevance of this prediction to experiment is discussed.},

We find that PAW results strongly depend on the supercell size used in the calculations. In particular, for large supercells, the surface segregation energy of Cr is positive, which means that Cr should not segregate toward the surface of diluted alloys. This is in agreement with our EMTO-CPA results as well as previous surface Green’s-function calculations. However, the surface segregation energy of Cr is negative if small unit cells are used for simulations. This is in agreement with previous full-potential supercell calculations.

Multiscale numerical modeling (Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics, and Brownian dynamics) was used to quantify the importance of the various relaxation mechanisms likely to be responsible for the NMR relaxation of the water molecules within such complex environment. Because of the significant fraction of iron present in these natural clays, the large value of the transverse relaxation rate measured for the confined water molecules is compatible with a dominant paramagnetic coupling modulated by the long-range diffusion of water molecules. Finally, the angular variation of the apparent relaxation rate can be used to extract the distribution of the directors of the clay lamellae within the self-supporting film.},

	abstract = {This is a first density functional theory survey of transition-metal biliverdines (Blv), where we have chosen to focus on key Mn, Fe, Co, and Cu complexes. According to the calculations, the complexes are invariably noninnocent, featuring Blv?2- ligand radicals. In this, biliverdine complexes resemble metallocorroles, but the parallels are only approximate. Briefly, metallobiliverdines exhibit a much greater tendency to adopt noninnocent electronic structures than analogous metallocorroles. The O···O nonbonded contacts in biliverdines apparently preclude the formation of short metal?N bonds that, in turn, could stabilize high-valent metal ions. Thus, while most copper corroles (Cor) exhibit diamagnetic CuIII ground states, copper biliverdines are clearly CuIIBlv?2- species. In the same spirit, while chloroiron corroles are best described as FeIII(S = 3/2)Cor?2-, the analogous biliverdine derivative seems best described as FeIII(S = 5/2)Blv?2-, i.e., featuring a high-spin FeIII center with long ({\textgreater}2.0 Å) Fe?N bond distances. Overall, the results highlight the important role that steric effects may play in modulating the electronic structures and the potentially noninnocent nature of transition-metal complexes.},

	abstract = {Doping is generally used to tune and enhance the properties of metal oxides. However, their chemical composition cannot be readily modified beyond low dopant amounts without disrupting the crystalline atomic structure. In the case of anatase TiO2, we introduce a new solution-based chemical route allowing the composition to be significantly modified, substituting the divalent O2? anions by monovalent F? and OH? anions resulting in the formation of cationic Ti4+ vacancies (?) whose concentration can be controlled by the reaction temperature. The resulting polyanionic anatase has the general composition Ti1?x?y?x+yO2?4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y, reaching vacancy concentrations of up to 22\%, i.e., Ti0.78?0.22O1.12F0.4(OH)0.48. Solid-state 19F NMR spectroscopy reveals that fluoride ions can accommodate up to three different environments, depending on Ti and vacancies (i.e. Ti3-F, Ti2?1-F, and Ti1?2-F), with a preferential location close to vacancies. DFT calculations further confirm the fluoride/vacancy ordering. When its characteristics were evaluated as an electrode for reversible Li-ion storage, the material shows a modified lithium reaction mechanism, which has been rationalized by the occurrence of cationic vacancies acting as additional lithium hosting sites within the anatase framework. Finally, the material shows a fast discharging/charging behavior, compared to TiO2, highlighting the benefits of the structural modifications and paving the way for the design of advanced electrode materials, based on a defect mediated mechanism.},

XRD analyses performed after washing and heat-treatment at various temperatures have revealed the presence of graphitised and amorphous phases. The d002 values were close to the ideal one obtained for pure graphite. Raman spectroscopy has pointed out surface disordering which increases with increasing temperature of the heat-treatment. The presence of Na and Li on the surface of the carbon powder has been evidenced by SIMS. The maximum Na and Li contents were observed for carbon samples heat-treated at 400 °C. Their electrochemical performances vs. the insertion/deinsertion of lithium cations were studied in 1 M LiPF6–EC : DEC : DMC (2 : 1 : 2). The first charge–discharge cycle is characterised by a high irreversible capacity as in the case of hard-disordered carbon materials. However, the potential profile in galvanostatic mode is intermediate between that usually observed for graphite and amorphous carbon: rather continuous charge–discharge curves sloping between 1.5 and 0.3 V vs. Li / Li+, and successive phase transformations between 0.3 and 0.02 V vs. Li / Li+. The best electrochemical performances were obtained with carbon powders heat-treated at 400 °C which exhibits a reversible capacity value of 1080 mAh g− 1 (composition of Li2.9C6). This sample has also both the lowest surface disordering (deduced from Raman spectroscopy), and the highest Na and Li surface contents (deduced from SIMS).},

A powder-averaged two-dimensional (2D) diffusion model applied to the monohydrated state yields a 2D diffusion coefficient in the plane of the clay layers () of 2.8 × 10−10 m2 s−1, where an isotropic analysis of the data would have underestimated the diffusion coefficient by approximately 25\%. In the case of the bihydrated state, the analysis by a model including a possible diffusion perpendicular to the clay layers () leads to a range of values for between 3.5 and 8.7 × 10−10 m2 s−1, depending on the ratio .

This explains the presence of molecular water as observed experimentally.

	abstract = {Although many formally Fe(V) intermediates are known in the form of peroxidase compound I intermediates and their synthetic models, ?true? d3 FeVO intermediates have remained elusive and hence a Holy Grail of sorts for many bioinorganic chemists. Very recently, Newcomb and co-workers provided transient absorption spectroscopic evidence suggestive of FeVO corrole intermediates. Here, we report DFT calculations predicting nearly isoenergetic FeVO and FeIVO corrolato2-· states for Fe(corrolato)(O) intermediates. In the course of a theoretical search for systems in which a true FeVO state might be favored by a clear and substantial margin of energy, we have identified corrolazine as a promising supporting ligand; thus, we find that with corrolazine, the FeVO states are favored by at least 0.5 eV over FeIVO corrolazinato2-· states.},

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

Different boundary conditions were investigated in the simulations, but neither the boundary conditions nor the system size have any significant effect on the different time correlation functions (tcf:s) calculated. It is found that the field gradient tcf, determining the NMR relaxation rate for these ions, is almost completely due to the water molecules in the first shell. The calculated field gradient tcf:s show a complex time‐dependence not describable with a mono‐exponential decay. The very rapid decay shown by the field gradient tcf for all three ions can partly be attributed to a correlated water motion in the first hydration shell. The relaxation rates obtained from the simulations are in excellent agreement with experimental data for Na+ and Cl−, while the Li+ relaxation rate is less well produced.},

This quantity is known to vary with the polarizability of the Lewis base. In protic solvents, the Lewis definition of basicity is barely used; it is replaced by the more purpose-built Brønsted-Lowry scale, and its generalized variant proposed by Hammett. In this study, individual molecular polarizabilities were computed from first-principles for a series of protic solvents: pure water, hydrogen fluoride, ammonia and their mixtures. From these calculations optical basicity scales were set up for each Lewis base. It was shown that these scales correlate with the Hammett acidity. It is therefore possible to build a common optical basicity scale, in which any material (protic solvents, inorganic materials) can unambiguously be classified.},

However, the head?tail repulsion is not the only factor affecting the micelle formation. For the first time, we present a systematic study of the effect of chain rigidity on critical micelle concentration and micelle size, which is performed with the dissipative particle dynamics simulation method. Rigidity of the coarse-grained surfactant molecule was controlled by the harmonic bonds set between the second-neighbor beads. Compared to flexible molecules with the nearest-neighbor bonds being the only type of bonded interactions, rigid molecules exhibited a lower critical micelle concentration and formed larger and better-defined micelles. By varying the strength of head?tail repulsion and the chain rigidity, we constructed two-dimensional diagrams presenting how the critical micelle concentration and aggregation number depend on these parameters. We found that the solutions of flexible and rigid molecules that exhibited approximately the same critical micelle concentration could differ substantially in the micelle size and shape depending on the chain rigidity. With the increase of surfactant concentration, primary micelles of more rigid molecules were found less keen to agglomeration and formation of nonspherical aggregates characteristic of flexible molecules.},

	abstract = {The structure of the nitrogenase MoFe-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii has been refined to 2.0 Å resolution in two oxidation states. EPR studies on the crystals indicate that the structures correspond to the spectroscopically assigned oxidized (POX/MOX) and the native or dithionite-reduced (PN/MN) forms of the enzyme. Both MoFe-protein structures are essentially identical, with the exception of the P-cluster. The MoFe-protein P-cluster in each state is found to contain eight Fe and seven S atoms. Interconversion between the two redox states involves movement of two Fe atoms and an exchange of protein coordination for ligands supplied by a central S atom. In the oxidized POX state, the cluster is coordinated by the protein through six cysteine ligands, Ser-?188 O?, and the backbone amide of Cys-α88. In the native PN state, Ser-?188 O? and the amide N of Cys-α88 no longer coordinate the cluster due to movement of their coordinated Fe atoms toward the central sulfur. Consequently, this central sulfur adopts a distorted octahedral environment with six surrounding Fe atoms. A previously described model of the P-cluster containing 8Fe-8S likely reflects the inappropriate modeling of a single structure to a mixture of these two P-cluster redox states. These observed redox-mediated structural changes of the P-cluster suggest a role for this cluster in coupling electron transfer and proton transfer in nitrogenase.},

We have now extended this model to more general lattice gases where v(r)=∞ for r in some domain D, i.e., lattice gases of particles with extended hard cores. This permits extension of the model to continuum systems. We find, for this model, that the direct correlation function of Ornstein and Zernike is equal to −βv(r) (β the reciprocal temperature) for r not in D, and is determined for r in D by the requirement that the two-particle distribution functions n2(r1,r2) vanish for r1,2 in D. All higher order (modified) Ursell functions (spin semi-invariants) vanish for the model. The model thus yields the same pair distribution function as the Percus-Yevick integral equation for the case when v(r)=0 for r not in D, giving also, incidentally, an upper bound to the density for which solutions of this equation exist. The thermodynamic properties of this model are also discussed and it is shown that the partition function becomes singular in the continuum limit.},

With the addition of atomic site charges we take advantage of the formal long-ranged potential field cancellations before renormalization to generate a set of numerically stable equations. Results for calculations in a minimal (spherical) angular basis set are presented for the radial distribution function, the first dipolar (110) projection, and the dielectric constant for two model diatomic systems. All results, when compared to experiment and simulation, are a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement over previous site-site theories. More importantly, the dielectric constant is not trivial and close to simulation and experiment.},

The publication of papers on the MAX phases has shown an almost exponential increase in the past decade. The existence of further MAX phases has been reported or proposed. In addition to surveying this activity, the synthesis of MAX phases in the forms of bulk, films and powders is reviewed, together with their physical, mechanical and corrosion/oxidation properties. Recent research and development has revealed potential for the practical application of the MAX phases (particularly using the pressureless sintering and physical vapour deposition coating routes) as well as of MAX based composites. The challenges for the immediate future are to explore further and characterise the MAX phases reported to date and to make further progress in facilitating their industrial application.},

	abstract = {We employ spin-polarized periodic density functional theory (DFT) to examine carbon atom adsorption on, absorption in, and diffusion into Fe(110) and Fe(100). We find that carbon atoms bind strongly with Fe surfaces and prefer high coordination sites. The carbon atom is predicted to adsorb on the long-bridge site on Fe(110) and the fourfold hollow site on Fe(100). Due to the very short distance between the carbon atom and the subsurface Fe atom of Fe(100), the carbon atom binds more strongly with Fe(100) than with Fe(110). In the subsurface region, the carbon atom prefers the octahedral site, as in bulk Fe. We find that the carbon atom is more stable in the subsurface octahedral site of Fe(110) than that of Fe(100), since the strain caused by the interstitial carbon atom is released by pushing one surface Fe atom towards vacuum by 0.5 Å in Fe(110), while the distortion in Fe(100) propagates far into the lattice. Diffusion of carbon atoms into Fe(110) and Fe(100) subsurfaces goes through transition states where the carbon atom is coordinated to four Fe atoms. The barriers to diffusion into Fe(110) and Fe(100) are 1.18 eV and 1.47 eV, respectively. The larger diffusion barrier into Fe(100) is mainly due to the stronger bonding between carbon and the Fe(100) surface. We predict that the rate-limiting step for C incorporation into bulk Fe is the initial diffusion to subsurface sites, while the rate-limiting step for absorbed carbon segregation to the surface is bulk diffusion, with no expected difference between rates to segregate to different surfaces. Lastly, we predict that graphite formation will be more favorable on C-covered Fe(110) than C-covered Fe(100).},

	abstract = {A simple and robust formulation of the path-independent confinement method for the calculation of free energies is presented. The simplified confinement method (SCM) does not require matrix diagonalization or switching off the molecular force field, and has a simple convergence criterion. The method can be readily implemented in molecular dynamics programs with minimal or no code modifications. Because the confinement method is a special case of thermodynamic integration, it is trivially parallel over the integration variable. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated using a model diatomic molecule, for which exact results can be computed analytically. The method is then applied to the alanine dipeptide in vacuum, and to the α-helix ? ?-sheet transition in a 16-residue peptide modeled in implicit solvent. The SCM requires less effort for the calculation of free energy differences than previous formulations because it does not require computing normal modes. The SCM has a diminished advantage for determining absolute free energy values, because it requires decreasing the MD integration step to obtain accurate results. An approximate confinement procedure is introduced, which can be used to estimate directly the configurational entropy difference between two macrostates, without the need for additional computation of the difference in the free energy or enthalpy. The approximation has convergence properties similar to those of the standard confinement method for the calculation of free energies. The use of the approximation requires about 5 times less wall-clock simulation time than that needed to compute enthalpy differences to similar precision from an MD trajectory. For the biomolecular systems considered in this study, the errors in the entropy approximation are under 10\%. Practical applications of the methods to proteins are currently limited to implicit solvent simulations.},

As the confinement is increased, water confined by the hydrophobic methyl terminated SAMs experiences capillary evaporation. As a consequence, the adhesion energy is determined by the direct interaction between bare SAMs. In the asymmetric system, an incomplete capillary evaporation is observed, with the number of water molecules dropped by more than an order of magnitude. The remaining water molecules are all adsorbed on the hydrophilic SAM, while the hydrophobic SAM is separated from the rest of the system by a thin vapor layer.

The results are checked against independent data on the low-temperature miscibility gap, using increasingly accurate thermodynamic models, first by the inclusion of the magnetic degrees of freedom of iron and then also by the inclusion of the magnetic degrees of freedom of chromium. It is shown that a reasonably accurate description of the phase diagram at the iron-rich side (i.e. the miscibility gap borders and the Curie line) is obtained, but only at expense of the agreement with the above mentioned thermochemical data.

In addition, nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations show that the CFM predicts a decrease of the thermal conductivity with temperature, as observed in the experiment, but this dependence is reproduced qualitatively at temperatures characteristic of supercooled states. These results emphasize the need for further studies of the heat conduction and properties of water in these conditions.

The predictions of the model are compared against the standard model for describing ions next to charged interfaces, consisting of Poisson–Boltzmann theory with additional constants describing ion binding, which are specific to the counterion and the interfacial charge (“chemical binding”). It is shown that the “chemical” model can be appropriately described by an underlying “physical” model over several decades in concentration, but the extracted binding constants are not uniquely defined, as they differ depending on the particular observable quantity being studied. It is also shown that electrostatic correlations for divalent (or higher valence) ions enhance the surface charge by increasing deprotonation, an effect not properly accounted within chemical models. The charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine is analyzed as a concrete example with good agreement with experimental results. We conclude with a detailed discussion on the limitations of chemical or physical models for describing the rich phenomenology of charged interfaces in aqueous media and its relevance to different systems with a particular emphasis on phospholipids.},

	abstract = {A laminar stationary flow of viscous fluid in a cylindrical tube enhances the rate of diffusion of Brownian particles along the tube axis. This so-called Aris-Taylor dispersion is due to the fact that cumulative times, spent by a diffusing particle in layers of the fluid moving with different velocities, are random variables which depend on the realization of the particle stochastic trajectory in the radial direction. Conceptually similar increase of the diffusivity occurs when the particle randomly jumps between two states with different drift velocities. Here we develop a theory that contains both phenomena as special limiting cases. It is assumed (i) that the particle in the flow can reversibly bind to the tube wall, where it moves with a given drift velocity and diffusivity, and (ii) that the radial and longitudinal diffusivities of the particle in the flow may be different. We derive analytical expressions for the effective drift velocity and diffusivity of the particle, which show how these quantities depend on the geometric and kinetic parameters of the model.},

Calculations for commensurate antiferromagnetic Cr show that the PW GGA-II predicts an overly large moment of 1.4μB while the LM functional yields a moment of 0.88 μB, which is also larger than experiment. Furthermore the PW GGA-II yields a large magnetic energy for Cr which is difficult to reconcile with the observed spin-density-wave ground state.},

Here, we investigate an approach for the sampling of unbiased reduced density matrices within the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo dynamic, which requires only small computational overheads. This is achieved via an independent replica population of walkers in the dynamic, sampled alongside the original population. The resulting reduced density matrices are free from systematic error (beyond those present via constraints on the dynamic itself) and can be used to compute a variety of expectation values and properties, with rapid convergence to an exact limit. A quasi-variational energy estimate derived from these density matrices is proposed as an accurate alternative to the projected estimator for multiconfigurational wavefunctions, while its variational property could potentially lend itself to accurate extrapolation approaches in larger systems.},

While originally developed for gas-phase molecules and bulk liquid water, the potential is transferrable to nanoconfinement and interface scenarios. Applied here, it shows proton behavior consistent with ab initio calculations and empirical models specifically designed to describe proton transport. Both Eigen and Zundel complexes are observed in the simulations showing the Eigen?Zundel?Eigen-type mechanism. In addition to reproducing the short-time rattling of the excess proton between the two oxygens of Zundel complexes, a picosecond-scale lifetime was also found. These longer-lived H3O+ ions are caused by the rapid conversion of the local solvation structure around the transferring proton from a Zundel-like form to an Eigen-like form following the transfer, effectively severing the path along which the proton can rattle. The migration of H+ over long times ({\textgreater}100 ps) deviates from the conventional short-time multiexponentially decaying lifetime autocorrelation model and follows the t?3/2 power-law behavior. The potential function employed here matches many of the features of proton transport observed in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations as well as the highly developed empirical valence bond models, yet is computationally very efficient, enabling longer time and larger systems to be studied.},

Electrodes having the (101) face exposed doped by reduction with hydrogen were employed. The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical behavior of a single crystal of anatase were scrutinized for the first time. Properties were compared to those of single-crystal rutile having the (001) face exposed. Impedance analysis established that the flatband potential of anatase (101) is shifted negatively by 0.2 V with regards to that of rutile (001). Interfacial capacitance measurements under forward bias indicate smaller density of surface states on anatase. Photoelectrochemical oxidation of water occurs on both rutile and anatase with incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies close to unity at ? = 300 nm. From the comparison of Ufb and Eg, it follows that anatase (101) and rutile (001) electrodes differ mainly in the position of the conduction band edge. The complete photoelectrolysis of water to H2 and O2 is thermodynamically possible on anatase only. Photosensitized electron injection from adsorbed cis-Ru[L2(SCN)2] (L = 2,2?-bipyridyl-4,4?-dicarboxylic acid) proceeds with similar efficiency on both types of electrodes. However, light-induced charge separation on the single-crystal electrodes is about three times less efficient compared with nanoscopic anatase films. Anatase (101) is strikingly more active for electrochemical insertion of Li+ than rutile (001). The diffusion coefficients for Li+ insertion and extraction were estimated to be 2 ? 10-13 and 6 ? 10-13 cm2/s, respectively.},

Through comparison with molecular simulation, we show that our model captures the length-scale and curvature dependence of solvation free energies with near-quantitative accuracy and 2–3 orders of magnitude less computational effort, and further, correctly describes the large but rare solvent fluctuations that are involved in dewetting, vapor tube formation, and hydrophobic assembly. Our model is intermediate in detail and complexity between implicit-solvent models and explicit-water simulations.},

An attempt is made to explain the anomalous behaviour of the alloy characteristics (short-range order, Curie temperature, electrical resistance, and crystal-lattice parameter) at low chromium concentrations (less than 10 at. \%) by the fact that the appearance of a chromium atom causes a perturbation of the magnetic structure in a large zone of the alpha-iron lattice surrounding the impurity atom. A cluster strongly differing in its properties from pure iron is brought about by this perturbation. As the concentration is increased, the zones of the magnetic perturbation begin overlap, which leads to a decrease in the energy of chromium-iron interaction in the range of x(Cr) {\textgreater} 0.03. Upon further growth of the chromium concentration, the parameters of the interaction depend only slightly on the concentration.},

	abstract = {This paper rigorously derives several classes of generalized Langevin equations (GLE) which describe the motion of an interacting many‐body system in a heat bath. The fundamental assumption in deriving these GLEs is that the Liouville operator representing the system–heat bath interaction LSR commutes with the global Liouville operator L. An important second dissipation–fluctuation theorem is put forward relating the memory kernel of the friction force to the correlation function between the potential force of the system and the random force from the heat bath and to the auto‐ and cross‐correlation functions of the random forces. Unlike most of the previous treatments in which the system, the heat bath and the system–heat bath interaction are greatly simplified, the properties of the system, the heat bath and the system–heat bath interaction remain general in this study. In particular, the interaction Hamiltonian may be arbitrarily nonlinear, so that the present theory is applicable to any physical system. Finally, a unified treatment for the GLEs, originally proposed by Ciccotti and Ryckaert for the systems in which there is no interaction among particles, is extended to many‐body systems with internal interactions and in a heat bath.},

The excellent electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is due to a reversible ion adsorption in porous carbon electrodes. Recently, it was demonstrated that ions from the electrolyte could enter sub nanometre pores, greatly increasing the capacitance. However, the molecular mechanism of this enhancement remains poorly understood. Here we provide the first quantitative picture of the structure of an ionic liquid adsorbed inside realistically modelled microporous carbon electrodes. We show how the separation of the positive and negative ions occurs inside the porous disordered carbons, yielding much higher capacitance values (125 F g−1) than with simpler electrode geometries. The proposed mechanism opens the door for the design of materials with improved energy storage capabilities. It also sheds new light on situations where ion adsorption in porous structures or membranes plays a role.},

Second, it is shown by simple kinematic considerations that the instantaneous velocity of the solute conditions to a considerable extent the character of the exchanges. Analytic formulas are derived which quantitatively estimate this effect, and which are of general applicability to molecular diffusion in any thermal fluid. Despite the simplicity of the kinematic considerations, they are shown to well describe many aspects of solvent exchange/diffusion coupling features for nontrivial systems.},

A rather simple property of the angular coupling coefficients of our former work allows us to write the Ornstein‐Zernike equation in irreducible form, as a set of uncoupled matrix equations, of rather small size. A generalization of Baxter's form of the Ornstein‐Zernike equation to matrices allows us to write a formal solution to the mean spherical model of neutral hard spheres with almost arbitrary electrostatic multipoles. This is an extension of Wertheim's solution for dipoles [J. Chem. Phys. 55, 4291 (1971)]. The formal solution consists in showing that the direct correlation function inside the hard core is a polynomial in the interatomic distance r. The coefficients of the polynomials are obtained by solving a set of quadratic matrix equations. The class of potentials that admit this kind of a solution is larger than the electrostatic multipole interaction but does not include some cross interactions like the dipole‐quadrupole interaction.},

We show that the friction coefficient exhibits a strong curvature dependence; while friction is independent of confinement for the graphene slab, it decreases with carbon nanotube radius for water inside, but increases for water outside. As a paradigm the friction coefficient is found to vanish below a threshold diameter for armchair nanotubes. Using a statistical description of the interfacial friction, we highlight here a structural origin of this curvature dependence, mainly associated with a curvature-induced incommensurability between the water and carbon structures. These results support the recent experiments reporting fast transport of water in nanometric carbon nanotube membranes.},

	abstract = {A classical density functional theory approach to solvation in molecular solvent is presented. The solvation properties of an arbitrary solute in a given solvent, both described by a molecular force field, can be obtained by minimization of a position and orientation-dependent free-energydensity functional. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, limited to two-body correlations, the unknown excess term of the functional approximated by the angular-dependent direct correlation function of the pure solvent. We show that this function can be extracted from a preliminary MD simulation of the pure solvent by computing the angular-dependent pair distribution function and solving subsequently the molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation using a discrete angular representation. The corresponding functional can then be minimized in the presence of an arbitrary solute on a three-dimensional cubic grid for positions and Gauss-Legendre angular grid for orientations to provide the solvation structure and free-energy. This two-step procedure is proved to be much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined to thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be relevant and accurate for prototype polar solvents such as the Stockmayer solvent or acetonitrile. For water, although correct for neutral or moderately charged solute, it tends to underestimate the tetrahedral solvation structure around H-bonded solutes, such as spherical ions. This can be corrected by introducing suitable three-body correlation terms that restore both an accurate hydration structure and a satisfactory energetics.},

	abstract = {Discovery of new materials is important for all fields of chemistry. Yet, existing compilations of all known ternary inorganic solids still miss many possible combinations. Here, we present an example of accelerated discovery of the missing materials using the inverse design approach, which couples predictive first-principles theoretical calculations with combinatorial and traditional experimental synthesis and characterization. The compounds in focus belong to the equiatomic (1:1:1) ABX family of ternary materials with 18 valence electrons per formula unit. Of the 45 possible V?IX?IV compounds, 29 are missing. Theoretical screening of their thermodynamic stability revealed eight new stable 1:1:1 compounds, including TaCoSn. Experimental synthesis of TaCoSn, the first ternary in the Ta?Co?Sn system, confirmed its predicted zincblende-derived crystal structure. These results demonstrate how discovery of new materials can be accelerated by the combination of high-throughput theoretical and experimental methods. Despite being made of three metallic elements, TaCoSn is predicted and explained to be a semiconductor. The band gap of this material is difficult to measure experimentally, probably due to a high concentration of interstitial cobalt defects.},

Principal structural changes were limited to the water phase, marked difference was observed in the modes of diffusion of Cs+ and Na+ ions. Cs+ ion exhibited a clear site-to-site diffusion between sites allowing coordination to six oxygen atoms of the clay sheets, this behaviour persisted to high temperatures. Preferential sites for the Na+ counterion were significantly less well-defined, even at low temperatures. Water phase showed similar behaviour in the Na/Cs-monohydrated systems, a rapid approach to bulk dynamics was seen in the transition from monohydrated to bihydrated Na-montmorillonite.},

	abstract = {The crystal structure of tetragonal hen egg-white lysozyme at a hydrostatic pressure of 1000 atmospheres has been determined by X-ray diffraction to a nominal resolution of 2 A. The crystals, originally grown in 0.83 M-NaCl, had to be transferred to 1.4 M-NaCl to prevent crystal cracking at 300 to 400 atm. The a and b axes of the unit cell contracted by 0.6\%, whilst the c axis increased by 0.1\%. The unit cell volume contracted by 1.1\%. Both the 1 atm and the 1000 atm structures were refined by restrained least-squares to yield final R factors of 14.9\% in each case. Since the data were collected by an accurate difference protocol, the change in structure is considered to be more accurate than the absolute structure. The probable accuracy of the atomic shifts is shown to be +/- 0.06 A. The estimated volume decrease of the whole molecule corresponded to an isothermal compressibility of 4.7 X 10(-3) kbar-1. The contraction was non-uniformly distributed. Domain 2 (residues 40 to 88) was essentially incompressible, whilst domain 1 (residues 1 to 39, 89 to 129) had a compressibility of 5.7 X 10(-3) kbar-1. The interdomain region was also compressible. The average B factor decreased about 1 A2 at 1000 atm, but there was a wide range of decreases and increases in individual values. The pressure-induced deformation was analyzed with difference distance matrices. The beta-sheet (residues 42 to 60) and helix 2 (residues 24 to 36) were deformed the least under pressure. The other helices were more deformed and one loop region (residues 61 to 87) actually appeared to expand. The main-chain atoms of the beta-sheet and helix 2 were used to perform a least-squares superposition of the 1 atm and 1000 atm models. The root-mean-square pressure-induced shift for all atoms was 0.2 A, with a few atoms moving more than 1 A. There was no evidence for co-ordinated movement about the hinge axis defined by alpha carbon atoms 38 and 97. The 1 atm and 1000 atm refined structures included 151 and 163 ordered water molecules, respectively. The changes in these ordered water molecules and the mean compressibility of all of the solvent in the crystal will be described elsewhere.},

We find that the fluctuations can be represented by a 0.93 scaling factor of the CSA tensor for both R1 and R2 relaxations for residues in helix, coil, and sheet alike. This result is important, as it establishes that 13C′ relaxation is a valid tool for measurement of interesting dynamical events in proteins.},

So far, atomistic simulations of this process have predicted Peierls stresses, the stress needed to overcome the crystal resistance in the absence of thermal fluctuations, of more than twice the experimental values, a discrepancy best-known in body-centred cubic crystals. Here we show that a large contribution arises from the crystal zero-point vibrations, which ease dislocation motion below typically half the Debye temperature. Using Wigner’s quantum transition state theory in atomistic models of crystals, we found a large decrease of the kink-pair formation enthalpy due to the quantization of the crystal vibrational modes. Consequently, the flow stress predicted by Orowan’s law is strongly reduced when compared with its classical approximation and in much closer agreement with experiments. This work advocates that quantum mechanics should be accounted for in simulations of materials and not only at very low temperatures or in light-atom systems.},

It is desirable to develop an algorithm for this step that scales linearly with system size. We discuss attempts to achieve linear scaling for the calculation of the matrix elements of the exchange-correlation and Coulomb potentials within a particular implementation (the Amsterdam density functional, ADF, code) of the KS method. In the ADF scheme the matrix elements are completely determined by 3D numerical integration, the value of the potentials in each grid point being determined with the help of an auxiliary function representation of the electronic density. Nearly linear scaling for building the total Fock matrix is demonstrated for systems of intermediate size (in the order of 1000 atoms). For larger systems further development is desirable for the treatment of the Coulomb potential.},

	abstract = {We examine the problem of simulating single and multiphase flow in porous medium systems at the pore scale using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. The LB method is a powerful approach, but one which is also computationally demanding; the resolution needed to resolve fundamental phenomena at the pore scale leads to very large lattice sizes, and hence substantial computational and memory requirements that necessitate the use of massively parallel computing approaches. Common LB implementations for simulating flow in porous media store the full lattice, making parallelization straightforward but wasteful. We investigate a two-stage implementation consisting of a sparse domain decomposition stage and a simulation stage that avoids the need to store and operate on lattice points located within a solid phase. A set of five domain decomposition approaches are investigated for single and multiphase flow through both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous medium systems on different parallel computing platforms. An orthogonal recursive bisection method yields the best performance of the methods investigated, showing near linear scaling and substantially less storage and computational time than the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {A particle diffusing in a tube with dead ends, from time to time enters a dead end, spends some time in the dead end, and then comes back to the tube. As a result, the particle spends in the tube only a part of the entire observation time that leads to slowdown of its diffusion along the tube. We study the transient diffusion in a tube with periodic identical dead ends formed by cavities of volume V cav connected to the tube by cylindrical channels of length L and radius a , which is assumed to be much smaller than the tube radius R and the distance l between neighboring dead ends. Assuming that the particle initial position is uniformly distributed over the tube, we analyze the monotonic decrease of the particle diffusion coefficient D ( t ) from its initial value D ( 0 ) = D , which characterizes diffusion in the tube without dead ends, to its asymptotic long-time value D ( ∞ ) = D eff \&lt; D . We derive an expression for the Laplace transform of D ( t ) , denoted by D ̂ ( s ) , where s is the Laplace parameter. Although the expression is too complicated to be inverted analytically, we use it to find the relaxation time of the process as a function of the geometric parameters of the system mentioned above. To check the accuracy of our results, we ran Brownian dynamics simulations and found the mean squared displacement of the particle as a function of time by averaging over 5 × 10 4 realizations of the particle trajectory. The time-dependent mean squared displacement found in simulations is compared with that obtained by numerically inverting the Laplace transform of the mean squared displacement predicted by the theory, which is given by 2 D ̂ ( s ) ∕ s . Comparison shows excellent agreement between the two time dependences that support the approximations used when developing the theory.},

	abstract = {Adenosine-5?-phosphosulfate reductase (APSR) is an iron?sulfur protein that catalyzes the reduction of adenosine-5?-phosphosulfate (APS) to sulfite. APSR coordinates to a [4Fe-4S] cluster via a conserved CC-X?80-CXXC motif, and the cluster is essential for catalysis. Despite extensive functional, structural, and spectroscopic studies, the exact role of the iron?sulfur cluster in APS reduction remains unknown. To gain an understanding into the role of the cluster, density functional theory (DFT) analysis and extended X-ray fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) have been performed to reveal insights into the coordination, geometry, and electrostatics of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data confirms that the cluster is in the [4Fe-4S]2+ state in both native and substrate-bound APSR while EXAFS data recorded at ?0.1 Å resolution indicates that there is no significant change in the structure of the [4Fe-4S] cluster between the native and substrate-bound forms of the protein. On the other hand, DFT calculations provide an insight into the subtle differences between the geometry of the cluster in the native and APS-bound forms of APSR. A comparison between models with and without the tandem cysteine pair coordination of the cluster suggests a role for the unique coordination in facilitating a compact geometric structure and ?fine-tuning? the electronic structure to prevent reduction of the cluster. Further, calculations using models in which residue Lys144 is mutated to Ala confirm the finding that Lys144 serves as a crucial link in the interactions involving the [4Fe-4S] cluster and APS.},

Via single exponential decay regression based extrapolations to the polymeric limit, significant variability in theoretically obtained WWES–T/AES–T predicted for longer polyacenes is evident that is primarily dependent on the model chemistry employed, with minor variations due to basis set incompleteness and zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections. With the exception of the B2PLYPD density functional (which, along with the mPW2PLYPD functional, combines exact HF exchange with an MP2-like correlation to the DFT calculation), all DFT methods investigated predict a negative WWES–T/AES–T (ground state triplet) at the polymer limit, with most functionals predicting a transition from a singlet to triplet ground state between octacene and decacene. Extrapolation of the B2PLYPD results predicts a vanishingly small singlet–triplet gap at the polymeric limit for an infinitely long homolog. Hartree–Fock calculations significantly underestimate the polyacene WWES–T/AES–T, whereas MPn methods overestimate the singlet–triplet gap but display a convergence toward experimental values with increasing truncation order and substitutions. The B2PLYPD and mPW2PLYPD functionals appear to balance the WWES–T/AES–T underestimating tendency of HF/DFT methods for longer polyacenes against the propensity for MPn methods to overestimate the WWES–T/AES–T for these compounds, and predict all acenes from benzene through decacene will be ground state singlets with positive singlet–triplet gaps.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the first microscopic approach to Brownian motion is developed in the case where the mass density of the suspending bath is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Brownian (B) particle. Starting from an extended Boltzmann equation, which describes correctly the interaction with the fluid, we derive systematically via multiple-time-scale analysis a reduced equation controlling the thermalization of the B particle, i.e., the relaxation toward the Maxwell distribution in velocity space. In contradistinction to the Fokker-Planck equation, the derived new evolution equation is nonlocal both in time and in velocity space, owing to correlated recollision events between the fluid and particle B. In the long-time limit, it describes a non-Markovian generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. However, in spite of this complex dynamical behavior, the Stokes-Einstein law relating the friction and diffusion coefficients is shown to remain valid. A microscopic expression for the friction coefficient is derived, which acquires the form of the Stokes law in the limit where the meanfree path in the gas is small compared to the radius of particle B.},

The segregation of 3d transition metals and their effects on oxygen adsorption on the Fe(1 0 0) surface are systematically studied using the First-principles calculations. On the one hand, Sc, Ti, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn have a tendency to segregate towards the surface, while V, Cr and Co prefer to remain in the interior of Fe bulk. Furthermore, the segregation energies varies monotonically from layers 1 to 5 for all 3d transition metals except Ti, Cr, Mn, whose subsurface layer provides a large barrier for surface segregation. On the other hand , attractive/repulsive interaction has been observed between oxygen and alloying atom with lower/higher atomic number than that of Fe. Based on the above results, the oxidation should be expected to occur preferentially at the Sc, Ti, and Mn segregation regions on the Fe(1 0 0) surface.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that due to a high surface-to-volume ratio, nanoporous materials display radiation tolerance. The abundance of surfaces, which are perfect sinks for defects, and the relation between ligament size, defect diffusion, and time combine to define a window of radiation resistance [Fu et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 101, 191607 (2012)]. Outside this window, the dominant defect created by irradiation in Au nanofoams are stacking fault tetrahedra (SFT). Molecular dynamics computer simulations of nanopillars, taken as the elemental constituent of foams, predict that SFTs act as dislocation sources inducing softening, in contrast to the usual behavior in bulk materials, where defects are obstacles to dislocation motion, producing hardening. In this work we test that prediction and answer the question whether irradiation actually hardens or softens a nanofam. Ne ion irradiations of gold nanofoams were performed at room temperature for a total dose up to 4 dpa, and their mechanical behavior was measured by nanoindentation. We find that hardness increases after irradiation, a result that we analyze in terms of the role of SFTs on the deformation mode of foams.},

The model involves one parameter which is an exponent determining how strongly the attraction decays with the distance. In addition, the model is run iteratively so that existing clusters can grow (together) and new ones can emerge. The model is capable of reproducing the size distribution and the fractality of the boundary of the largest cluster. Although the power-law distribution depends on both, the imposed exponent and the iteration, the fractality seems to be independent of the former and only depends on the latter.

Our study shows a strong coupling over a wide range of temperatures. We found that the onset of anharmonic behavior was dictated by changes in the dynamics and relaxation processes in the trehalose glass. The physical origin of protein-trehalose coupling was traced to the hydrogen bonds formed at the interface between the protein and the solvent. Moreover, protein-solvent hydrogen bonding was found to control the structural relaxation of the protein. The dynamics of the protein was found to be heterogeneous; the motions of surface and core atoms had different dependencies on temperature and, in addition, the surface atoms were more sensitive to the dynamics of the solvent than the core atoms. From the solvent perspective we found that the dynamics near the protein surface showed an unexpected enhanced mobility compared to the bulk. These results shed some light on the microscopic origins of the dynamical coupling in protein-solvent systems.},

Regarding polymers in organic solvents, the physical mechanism changes with decreasing molecular weight: high polymers are described in the framework of macroscopic hydrodynamics; for short chains and molecular mixtures of similar size, the Brownian motion of solute and solvent becomes important.},

The interatomic potential model has three important submodels corresponding to electrostatic interactions, making and breaking of covalent bonds, and treatment of electron exchange and correlation through a van der Waals potential. A polarizable diffuse charge density function was used to describe Coulombic interactions between atoms. Most of the model parameters were obtained from ab initio data for a lone water molecule. Molecules respond realistically to their electrochemical environment by the use of coupled fluctuating charge and fluctuating dipole dynamics, which controlled the charge density. The main purpose of the work is to develop a general model and framework for future studies, though some validation work was performed here. We applied the model to a MD simulation study of bulk properties of liquid water at room temperature and model gave good agreement with thermodynamic and transport properties at the same conditions. The model was then applied to a preliminary study of proton transfer, in which multiple proton transfer events were observed, though the rate of proton transfer was under-predicted by a factor of 5.},

Meaningful structural features appear on a length-scale where physical chemistry plays a central role either to impose a specific organisation on the material or to strongly modify the dynamics and the thermodynamics of the embedded fluids. A key issue is to understand how the geometrical and interfacial confinement affects numerous phenomena such as molecular diffusion, excitation relaxation, reaction kinetics, phase transitions, adsorption and capillary condensation. We will first review some experimental techniques able to image the 3D structure of disordered porous media. In the second part, we will analyse the geometrical and particularly some topological properties of a disordered porous material. We will discuss the interest and the limits of several strategies for obtaining 3D representations of various pore networks starting from an incomplete set of morphological characterisations. Finally, connection between geometry and diffusive transport will be presented, with emphasis on the application of pulsed gradient spin echo NMR technique as a tool for a multiscale analysis of transport in a confining geometry.},

We solve the 3D RISM integral equations by employing the modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace (MDIIS) method. The 3D site distributions of solvent around each solute are obtained and discussed. The PMF between the solutes is calculated as a 3D profile dependent on the relative position of the solutes at six characteristic relative orientations. The PMF obtained is in qualitative agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations. In the solvent, the AN- solute effectively attracts the DMA+ dimethylamino group and repels its phenyl ring. We found that the most stable relative arrangement of the DMA+ and AN- molecules in acetonitrile solvent is different from that in gas phase.},

	abstract = {Using molecular dynamics free energy simulations with TIP3P explicit solvent, we compute the hydration free energies of 504 neutral small organic molecules and compare them to experiments. We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an rms error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 kT) and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a Lennard-Jones well depth and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the nonpolar component of hydration free energies?that is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the nonpolar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total nonpolar free energy does not scale with the solute surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free energies and components will be valuable to others in the future development of force fields and solvation models.},

	abstract = {The MoFe protein of nitrogenase catalyzes the six-electron reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia. It has long been believed that this protein receives the multiple electrons it requires one at a time, from the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ couple of the Fe protein. Recently an all-ferrous [4Fe-4S]0 state of the Fe protein was demonstrated suggesting instead a series of two electron steps involving the [4Fe-4S]2+/0 couple. We have examined the interactions of the [4Fe-4S]0 Fe protein with nucleotides and its ability to transfer electrons to the MoFe protein. The [4Fe-4S]0 Fe protein binds both MgATP and MgADP and undergoes the MgATP induced conformational change and then binds properly to the MoFe protein, as evidenced by the fact that the behavior of the 0 and +1 oxidation states in the chelation and chelation protection assays are indistinguishable. Nucleotide binding does not effect the distinctive UV/Vis, CD, or Mössbauer spectra exhibited by the [4Fe-4S]0 Fe protein; however, because the intensity of the g = 16.4 EPR signal of the [4Fe-4S]0 Fe protein is extremely sensitive to minor variations of the rhombicity parameter E/D, the EPR signal is sensitive to the binding of nucleotides. A 50:50 mixture of [4Fe-4S]2+ and [4Fe-4S]0 Fe protein results in electron self-exchange and 100\% production of [4Fe-4S]+ Fe protein, demonstrating that the +1/0 couple is fully reversible. MgATP is absolutely required for electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S]0 Fe protein to the reduced state of the MoFe protein. In that reaction both electrons are transferred and are used to reduce substrate.},

GAS wave functions are obtained by defining an arbitrary number of active spaces with arbitrary occupation constraints. By a suitable choice of the GAS spaces, numerous ineffective configurations present in a large complete active space (CAS) can be removed, while keeping the important ones in the CI space. As a consequence, the GAS self-consistent field approach retains the accuracy of the CAS self-consistent field (CASSCF) ansatz and, at the same time, can deal with larger active spaces, which would be unaffordable at the CASSCF level. Test calculations on the Gd atom, Gd2 molecule, and oxoMn(salen) complex are presented. They show that GAS wave functions achieve the same accuracy as CAS wave functions on systems that would be prohibitive at the CAS level.},

The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.},

The method reproduces the solution of the complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) when the DMRG reference function is represented by a sufficiently large number of renormalized many-body basis, thereby being named DMRG-CASPT2 method. The DMRG-SCF is able to describe non-dynamical correlation with large active space that is insurmountable to the conventional CASSCF method, while the second-order perturbation theory provides an efficient description of dynamical correlation effects. The capability of our implementation is demonstrated for an application to the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer, which is one of the most demanding multireference systems that require best electronic structure treatment for non-dynamical and dynamical correlation as well as large basis sets. The DMRG-CASPT2/cc-pwCV5Z calculations were performed with a large (3d double-shell) active space consisting of 28 orbitals. Our approach using large-size DMRG reference addressed the problems of why the dissociation energy is largely overestimated by CASPT2 with the small active space consisting of 12 orbitals (3d4s), and also is oversensitive to the choice of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian.},

Substitutional Cr in the layers adjacent to the boundary shows anisotropic effect on the GB cohesion: it is neutral when placed in the (111) oriented Fe grains and enhances cohesion by 0.5 J/m2 when substituted in the boundary layer of the (210) grains. The strengthening effect of the Cr solute is dominated by the chemical component of the adhesive binding energy. Our calculations show that unlike the free iron surfaces, Cr impurities segregate to the boundaries of the Fe grains. The magnetic moments on GB atoms are substantially changed and their variation correlates with the corresponding relaxation pattern of the GB planes. The moments on Cr additions are two to four times enhanced in comparison with that in a Cr crystal and are antiparallel to the moments on the Fe atoms.},

The friction coefficient of a moving ion is computed in terms of the dimensionless coupling parameter where e is the ion charge, η is the solvent viscosity, ϵ0 and ϵ∞ are the low and high frequency dielectric constants of the solvent, respectively, τD is the Debye dielectric relaxation time of the pure solvent, and R is the ionic radius. For small ions the computed frictional drag is practically independent of ion radius, provided some degree of hydrodynamic slip is allowed at the ion surface. The effect of ion migration on the dielectric relaxation time of the solution is analyzed in detail. It is shown that the Debye–Falkenhagen effect should lead to an increase in the observed relaxation time, while the kinetic ion–solvent coupling introduces one or more relaxation times, all less than the Debye time of the pure solvent.},

	abstract = {The complete active space (CAS) SCF method is presented in detail with special emphasis on computational aspects. The CASSCF wave function is formed from a complete distribution of a number of active electrons in a set of active orbitals, which in general constitute a subset of the total occupied space. In contrast to other MCSCF schemes, a CASSCF calculation involves no selection of individual configurations, and the wave function therefore typically consists of a large number of terms. The largest case treated here includes 10 416 spin and space adapted configurations. To be able to treat such large CI expansions, a density‐matrix oriented formalism is used. The Newton–Raphson scheme is applied to calculate the orbital rotations, and the secular problem is solved with recent developments of CI techniques. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in calculations on the HNO molecule in ground and excited states, using a triple‐zeta basis and different sizes of the active space. With a reasonable choice of active space, the calculations converge in 6–10 iterations. This is true also for states which are not the lowest state of the symmetry in question. The equilibrium geometry for the ground state is R NO=1.215(1.212) Å, R NH =1.079(1.063) Å, ϑHNO=108.8(108.6) °, the experimental values given in parenthesis for comparison. The best estimates for the transition energies to the lowest 3 A ″ and 1 A ″ states are 0.67(0.85) eV and 1.52(1.63) eV, respectively. The results obtained indicate that the choice of active space may be crucial for the convergence properties of CASSCF calculations.},

	abstract = {Near-optimal strategies are developed for estimating the free energy difference between two canonical ensembles, given a Metropolis-type Monte Carlo program for sampling each one. The estimation strategy depends on the extent of overlap between the two ensembles, on the smoothness of the density-of-states as a function of the difference potential, and on the relative Monte Carlo sampling costs, per statistically independent data point. The best estimate of the free energy difference is usually obtained by dividing the available computer time approximately equally between the two ensembles; its efficiency (variance x computer time)-1 is never less, and may be several orders of magnitude greater, than that obtained by sampling only one ensemble, as is done in perturbation theory.},

	abstract = {We study here two-phase equilibria in driven compounds, where two dynamics are acting in parallel: thermally activated atomic jumps and forced jumps; such is the case for an alloy under irradiation where nuclear collisions induce ballistic jumps. We propose a deterministic treatment of the concentration and degree of order fields (one or two dimensional) and identify two-phase locally stable steady states: Dynamical equilibrium phase diagrams are thus computed. It is shown that in a body-centered-cubic alloy an A2-B2 order-disorder transition of the second kind at thermal equilibrium becomes of the first kind beyond a temperature-dependent critical forcing intensity. As a result, two-phase steady states can be stabilized by irradiation. Interface properties are then studied: Surface-tension-like effects are observed; introduction of antiphase boundaries destabilizes ordered precipitates, leading to their dissolution and redistribution. In order to compare the relative stability of the different steady states, a stochastic description is then proposed: We build a mean-field grand-canonical potential which governs the steady-state probability distribution of the concentration and long-range order parameter. It shows that the most stable steady state is indeed two-phase under suitable irradiation conditions.},

The alloys with less than 1.5 at.\% Fe have been found to have the same magnetic structure as that of pure Cr. With increasing Fe concentration, which corresponds to an increase of the electron to atom ratio, the Néel temperature decreases, the wave vector of the sinusoidally modulated spin density wave increases, while the magnetic moment remains almost constant. The spin-flip temperature also decreases rapidly. The alloys with concentrations between 2 and 4 at\% Fe have a simple antiferromagnetic structure at low temperatures, and the first order transition from the antiferromagnetic state to a sinusoidal spin state has been observed with increasing temperature. When the concentration of Fe exceeds 4 at\%, the alloy is a simple antiferromagnet up to the Néel temperature.

	abstract = {The differential capacitance curve for the double layer formed by an electrolyte dissolved in a solvent is commonly believed to be parabolic-like with a minimum at low electrolyte charge concentration and low electrode surface charge density, and independent of electrolyte concentration at high electrolyte concentrations and high electrode charge and would be, in the absence of solvent effects, featureless at these latter conditions. This is the prediction of the popular Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory. In contrast, for an ionic liquid this curve can have a single or a double hump (or a bell or camel shape). Fedorov et al. [Electrochem. Commun. 12, 296 (2010)]10.1016/j.elecom.2009.12.019 have related these humps, particularly the double hump, to the neutral tails of ions in many ionic liquids. Evidence presented here shows, however, that such humps are general features of the differential capacitance of a double layer, whether it be formed by ions with or without a neutral tail. The presence of a double or single hump results from the magnitude of the electrolyte charge concentration. For both spherical ions or non-spherical ions consisting of charged heads and neutral tails, the shape of the differential capacitance transforms continuously from a double hump to a single hump as the electrolyte concentration is increased.},

First, the adsorption of water molecules interacting with an optimized surface model has been studied. At low coverage, isolated water molecules adsorb preferentially on top of the surface nickel atoms, the plane defined by the H2O molecule being almost parallel to the surface. When the water coverage increases from 1/9 ML to 2/3 ML (ML = monolayer coverage), hydrogen bonds are created leading to the formation of water hexamers, as suggested experimentally on Ni(1 1 1) and other metallic surfaces [A. Michaelides, A. Alavi, D.A. King, Physical Review B 69 (2004) 113404. M. Nakamura, M. Ito, Chemical Physics Letters 325 (2000) 293-298]. Higher water coverage induces the formation of an additional water layer physisorbed over the cyclic hexamers. In a second step, the behavior of with respect to the hydrated Ni(1 1 1) face has been investigated. Evidence that two adsorption modes can take place was put forward: a first one with an outer sphere adsorption mechanism, where two water molecules of the uranyl ion first hydration shell are shared with four water hexamers, and a second one through a strong Ni-O-yle bond formation. Even though the second surface complex is energetically the most stable, the necessary activation energy to reach it makes it improbable.},

For example, they are of crucial importance in all chromatographic processes using porous hosts. Developing a thorough understanding about the complex interplay of molecular scale processes involved in surface interactions is an issue of current scientific activity. In the present paper we discuss ESR spectroscopy as a powerful and easy to apply tool for examining host?guest effects within mesoporous materials. The method is tested for a series of modified, mesoporous materials comprising different surface functionalities like amine groups, carboxy groups, and others. There is a characteristic influence on the rotational characteristics of a molecular nitroxide spin probe. From temperature dependent data one can derive key thermodynamic parameters like interaction enthalpies. It is possible to differentiate (qualitatively and quantitatively) between mobile spin probes interacting mainly with the solvent and immobile guests interacting mainly with the surfaces. The polarity difference ?pv between solvent and pore-surface determines if molecular guests are in a free and highly mobile, interacting but still mobile, or interacting and immobilized state. It is interesting to note that immobilization takes place even for moderate ?pv values no matter if the surface is polar or unpolar. However, the behavior changes if there is a chemically specific interaction between the functional groups of the guests with a functionalized surface. Based on the systematic effect of the pore size on the rotational dynamics of the spin probe a qualitative model is proposed that includes a characteristic distance between confined guest species and pore surface as a function of the interaction strength.},

This is the first treatment of photosystem II beyond the single-electron picture of density functional theory. Our calculations support recent modifications to the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. We further identify multiple low-lying energy surfaces associated with the structural distortion seen using X-ray crystallography, highlighting multistate reactivity in the chemistry of the cluster. Direct determination of Mn spin-projections from our wavefunctions suggests that current candidates that have been recently distinguished using parameterized spin models should be reassessed.

Two limiting cases are considered in detail, namely, when the constant drive is parallel to the principal or the diagonal array axes. This corresponds to studying the Brownian transport in periodic channels with reflecting walls of different topologies. The mobility and diffusivity of the transported particles in such channels are determined as functions of the drive and the array geometric parameters. Prominent transport features, like negative differential mobilities, excess diffusion peaks, and unconventional asymptotic behaviors, are explained in terms of two distinct lengths, the size of single obstacles (trapping length), and the lattice constant of the array (local correlation length). Local correlation effects are further analyzed by continuously rotating the drive between the two limiting orientations.},

	abstract = {The generalized Fick-Jacobs equation is widely used to study diffusion of Brownian particles in three-dimensional tubes and quasi-two-dimensional channels of varying constraint geometry. We show how this equation can be applied to study the slowdown of unconstrained diffusion in the presence of obstacles. Specifically, we study diffusion of a point Brownian particle in the presence of identical cylindrical obstacles arranged in a square lattice. The focus is on the effective diffusion coefficient of the particle in the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axes, as a function of the cylinder radii. As radii vary from zero to one half of the lattice period, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases from its value in the obstacle free space to zero. Using different versions of the generalized Fick-Jacobs equation, we derive simple approximate formulas, which give the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the cylinder radii, and compare their predictions with the values of the effective diffusion coefficient obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations. We find that both Reguera-Rubi and Kalinay-Percus versions of the generalized Fick-Jacobs equation lead to quite accurate predictions of the effective diffusion coefficient (with maximum relative errors below 4\% and 7\%, respectively) over the entire range of the cylinder radii from zero to one half of the lattice period.},

However, because drying around a single plate is not macroscopic, a molecular theory is required to describe it. The data are consistent with the rate-determining step in the hydrophobic collapse of the two plates being a large-scale drying fluctuation, characterized by a free-energy barrier that grows with particle size.},

It is now almost commonplace to publish an experimental paper together with quantum chemical calculations. The calculations serve either to validate the conclusions that have been reached from the analysis of the experiments or to distinguish between those possibilities that were left open. In addition, there are many purely theoretical investigations which address various structural and mechanistic aspects of metalloprotein structure and function. In this context the term ‘quantum chemical methods’ has been applied almost synonymously with density functional theory (DFT). Despite the enormous popularity of DFT in bioinorganic chemistry, one frequently voiced complaint from the experimental community is that the calculations often take too little or no notice of the available experimental results.

A simple double zeta basis set O(9s 5p/4s 2p), H(4s/2s) has been used to address this problem for the water molecule. Configuration interaction (CI) and multiconfiguration self‐consistent‐field (MCSCF) wave functions including up to all single, double, triple, and quadruple (SDTQ) excitations (a total of 17 678 1 A 1 configurations) have been obtained for this purpose. An interesting result is that the MCSCF wave function including only single excitations yields 52.3\% of the comparable correlation energy obtained with all single and double excitations. Using canonical SCF orbitals, triple excitations are found to contribute only 0.8\% of the correlation energy. However, the MCSCF procedure increases this correlation energy fraction by more than a factor of 5. The MCSCF energies for the wave functions including SD and SDTQ excitations are less than 0.001 hartree lower than the comparable straight CI energies.},

The resultant theory is applied to both neat Lennard-Jones fluids and cations in liquid water, and the response functions are obtained from the analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations. In the case of the self-diffusion of Lennard-Jones fluids, the responses of the solvation structures are in harmony with conventional pictures based on the mode-coupling theory, that is, the binary collision in the low-density fluids, the backflow effect from medium to high density fluids, and the backscatter effect in the liquids near the triple point. In the case of cations in water, the qualitative behavior is strongly dependent on the size of cations. The pictures similar to simple dense liquids are obtained for the large ion and the neutral molecule, while the solvent waters within the first solvation shell of small ions show an oscillatory response in the short-time region. In particular, the oscillation is remarkably underdumped for lithium ion. The origin of the oscillation is discussed in relation to the theoretical treatment of the translational diffusion of ions in water. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Increasing the voltage gradually suppresses overscreening in favor of the crowding of counterions in a condensed inner layer near the electrode.

	abstract = {We present a molecular theory for investigating the dynamics of ions in polar liquids. The theory is based on the interaction-site model for molecular liquids and on the generalized Langevin equation combined with the mode-coupling theory. The velocity autocorrelation function, diffusion and friction coefficients of ions in water at 25 °C and at infinite dilution are studied. The theoretical results for the velocity autocorrelation functions exhibit a gradual change from oscillatory to monotonic decay as the ion size increases. The diffusion (friction) coefficients of ions in aqueous solutions pass through a maximum (minimum) as a function of the ion size, with distinct curves and maxima (minima) for positive and negative ions. These trends are in complete accord with those of the molecular dynamics simulation results performed on the same system by Rasaiah and co-workers [J. Phys. Chem. B 102, 4193 (1998)]. It is worthwhile to mention that this is the first molecular theory that is capable of describing the difference in the dynamics of positive and negative ions in aqueous solutions. A further analysis of the friction coefficients of ions in water is presented in which the friction is decomposed into the “Stokes,” dielectric and their cross terms. The Stokes and dielectric terms arise from the coupling of the ion dynamics to essentially the acoustic dynamics of the solvent via the short-range interaction, and from the coupling to the optical mode of the solvent via the long-range interaction. The most striking feature of our results is that the Stokes friction so defined does not increase monotonically with increasing ion size, but decreases when ions are very small, implying a formation of a molecular “complex” comprising the ion and its nearest neighbor solvent molecules. Interesting observations concerning the cross term are: (1) its magnitude is rather large for small ions and cannot be neglected at all, and (2) the cross term for small ions seems to cancel out the Stokes part, and consequently the total friction for small ions seems to be to a large extent determined by its dielectric component. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

Within QSDFT, solid atoms are considered as quenched component(s) of the solid?fluid system with given density distribution(s). Solid?fluid intermolecular interactions are split into hard-sphere repulsive and mean-field attractive parts. The former are treated with the multicomponent fundamental measure density functional. Capabilities of QSDFT are demonstrated by drawing on the example of adsorption on amorphous silica materials. We show that, using established intermolecular potentials and a realistic model for silica surfaces, QSDFT quantitatively describes adsorption/desorption isotherms of Ar and Kr on reference MCM-41, SBA-15, and LiChrosphere materials in a wide range of relative pressures. QSDFT offers a systematic approach to the practical problems of characterization of microporous, mesoporous, and amorphous silica materials, including an assessment of microporosity, surface roughness, and adsorption deformation. Predictions for the pore diameter and the extent of pore surface roughness in MCM-41 and SBA-15 materials are in very good agreement with recent X-ray diffraction studies.},

For example, swelling, phase instability, hardening, flow localization, and embrittlement must be understood in order to estimate component lifetimes. Additional commonalities include reliance on the same classes of materials and sometimes on the identical alloy for critical components. In addition, databases supporting designs are mainly derived from the same relatively few irradiation facilities and from similar types of experiments. Opportunities are examined for coordinated efforts.

The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included.
The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

Based on the book Diffusion in Zeolites and other Microporous Solids, originally published in 1992, it illustrates the remarkable speed with which this field has developed since that time. Specific topics include: new families of nanoporous materials, micro-imaging and single particle tracking, direct monitoring of transient profiles by interference microscopy, single file diffusion and new approaches to molecular modeling.},

The purpose of the study was to examine how the Marcus curves depend on the applied potential and on the distance of the redox species from an electrode. The pronounced oscillations in the mean electrical potential seen in molten salt systems in the “double-layer” region are not reflected in the reaction free energy for the electron transfer event. The reorganization energy depends markedly on the distance of the redox ion from the electrode surface because of image charge effects.},

It also provides an inversion formula which, in theory, can be used to infer the form of the two-particle interaction energy as a function of distance in the crystal.

	abstract = {The second Wien effect describes the nonlinear, non-equilibrium response of a weak electrolyte in moderate to high electric fields. Onsager’s 1934 electrodiffusion theory, along with various extensions, has been invoked for systems and phenomena as diverse as solar cells, surfactant solutions, water splitting reactions, dielectric liquids, electrohydrodynamic flow, water and ice physics, electrical double layers, non-ohmic conduction in semiconductors and oxide glasses, biochemical nerve response and magnetic monopoles in spin ice. In view of this technological importance and the experimental ubiquity of such phenomena, it is surprising that Onsager’s Wien effect has never been studied by numerical simulation. Here we present simulations of a lattice Coulomb gas, treating the widely applicable case of a double equilibrium for free charge generation. We obtain detailed characterization of the Wien effect and confirm the accuracy of the analytical theories as regards the field evolution of the free charge density and correlations. We also demonstrate that simulations can uncover further corrections, such as how the field-dependent conductivity may be influenced by details of microscopic dynamics. We conclude that lattice simulation offers a powerful means by which to model and investigate system-specific corrections to the Onsager theory, and thus constitutes a valuable tool for detailed theoretical studies of the numerous practical applications of the second Wien effect.},

	abstract = {A new formalism for quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical (QM/MM) dynamics of chemical species in solution has been developed, which does not require the construction of any other potential functions except those for solvent–solvent interactions, maintains all the advantages of large simulation boxes and ensures the accuracy of ab initio quantum mechanics for all forces acting in the chemically most relevant region. Interactions between solute and more distant solvent molecules are incorporated by a dynamically adjusted force field corresponding to the actual molecular configuration of the simulated system and charges derived from the electron distribution in the solvate. The new formalism has been tested with some examples of hydrated ions, for which accurate conventional ab initio QM/MM simulations have been previously performed, and the comparison shows equivalence and in some aspects superiority of the new method. As this simulation procedure does not require any tedious construction of two-and three-body interaction potentials inherent to conventional QM/MM approaches, it opens the straightforward access to ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of any kind of solutes, such as metal complexes and other composite species in solution.},

	abstract = {We investigate methodological issues concerning the direct coexistence method, an increasingly popular approach to evaluate the solid-fluid coexistence by means of computer simulations. The first issue is the impact of the simulation ensemble on the results. We compare the NpT ensemble (easy to use but approximate) with the Np z T ensemble (rigorous but more difficult to handle). Our work shows that both ensembles yield similar results for large systems (\&gt;5000 particles). Another issue, which is usually disregarded, is the stochastic character of a direct coexistence simulation. Here, we assess the impact of stochasticity in the determination of the coexistence point. We demonstrate that the error generated by stochasticity is much larger than that caused by the use of the NpT ensemble, and can be minimized by simply increasing the system size. To perform this study we use the pseudo hard-sphere model recently proposed by Jover et al. [J. Chem. Phys.137, 144505 (2012)], and obtain a coexistence pressure of p* = 11.65(1), quite similar to that of hard spheres (only about 0.6\% higher). Therefore, we conclude that this model can be reliably used to investigate the physics of hard spheres in phenomena like crystal nucleation.},

Nevertheless, these series of calculations provide an appropriate benchmark for density functional theory based methods. Here, the usual broken symmetry approach provides a convenient framework to predict the magnetic coupling constants but requires deriving the appropriate mapping. At variance with simple dinuclear complexes, spin projection based techniques cannot recover the corresponding (approximate) spin adapted solution. Present results also show that current implementation of spin flip techniques leads to unphysical results.},

	abstract = {A self‐consistent, kinetic theory of ion–solvent interactions is developed within the framework of continuum mechanics. It is shown that the hydrodynamic coupling between viscous momentum transport and dielectric relaxation leads not only to a theory of ion mobility but also to a description of the dielectric properties of electrolyte solutions. The concept of kinetic polarization deficiency is introduced, whereby the static permittivity of a solution is reduced from that of the pure solvent by an amount proportional to the product of solvent dielectric relaxation time and low frequency conductivity of the solution. Furthermore, if the viscous and dielectric relaxation times are assumed to be comparable it is demonstrated that ’’deformation inertia’’ should make a significant contribution to the decrement Δϵ0. Ion mobility is calculated to first order in a coupling parameter which is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the ion radius, the limiting case of zero ion size is analyzed, and general aspects of ion migration are investigated with the aid of the principle of minimum dissipation. Given that the pure solvent has a dispersion characterized by a single Debye relaxation time τD, it is asserted that the solution will, as a consequence of dielectric friction, possess an infinite number of relaxation times extending from τD down to the longitudinal time τL=τD(ϵ∞/ϵ0).},

We observe links between the structuring of the solvent and the computed PMF for methane–methane association.

	abstract = {We present results of lattice-Boltzmann simulations to calculate flow in realistic porous media. Two examples are given for lattice-Boltzmann simulations in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) rock samples. First, we show lattice-Boltzmann simulation results of the flow in quasi-two-dimensional micromodels. The third dimension was taken into account using an effective viscous drag force. In this case, we consider a 2D micromodel of Berea sandstone. We calculate the flow field and permeability of the micromodel and find excellent agreement with Microparticle Image Velocimetry ( μ -PIV) experiments. Then, we use a particle tracking algorithm to calculate the dispersion of tracer particles in the Berea geometry, using the lattice-Boltzmann flow field. Second, we use lattice-Boltzmann simulations to calculate the flow in Bentheimer sandstone. The data set used in this study was obtained using X-ray microtomography (XMT). First, we consider a single phase flow. We systematically study the effect of system size and validate Darcy’s law from the linear dependence of the flux on the body force exerted. We observe that the values of the permeability measurements as a function of porosity tend to concentrate in a narrower region of the porosity, as the system size of the computational sub-sample increases. Finally, we compute relative permeabilities for binary immiscible fluids in the XMT rock sample.},

Results from a set of simulations on Lennard-Jones particles are presented. A simple analytic model for the diffusion constant in supercooled and normal liquids that is based on estimates of the activation energy obtained via the cage correlation function is derived.

Furthermore, L10 is an adaptive structure on the fcc-restricted convex hull which relates to the low energies of antiphase boundaries. Fcc-L12 is energetically degenerate with fcc-D023 for both Co3Pt and CoPt3. L12-Co3Pt and L10-CoPt belong to the fcc-restricted convex hull.

	abstract = {The solvent molecular distribution significantly affects the behavior of the solute molecules and is thus important in studying many biological phenomena. It can be described by the solvent molecular density distribution, g, and the solvent electric dipole distribution, p. The g and p can be computed directly by counting the number of solvent molecules/dipoles in a microscopic volume centered at r during a simulation or indirectly from the mean force F and electrostatic field E acting on the solvent molecule at r, respectively. However, it is not clear how the g and p derived from simulations depend on the solvent molecular center or the solute charge and if the gF and pE computed from the mean force and electric field acting on the solvent molecule, respectively, could reproduce the corresponding g and p obtained by direct counting. Hence, we have computed g,p,gF, and pE using different water centers from simulations of a solute atom of varying charge solvated in TIP3P water. The results show that gF and pE can reproduce the g and p obtained using a given count center. This implies that rather than solving the coordinates of each water molecule by MD simulations, the distribution of water molecules could be indirectly obtained from analytical formulas for the mean force F and electrostatic field E acting on the solvent molecule at r. Furthermore, the dependence of the g and p distributions on the solute charge revealed provides an estimate of the change in g and p surrounding a biomolecule upon a change in its conformation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The results show that for all cases the ground state of Cr is predicted to be of commensurate antiferromagnetic order, longitudinal SDWs lead to an increased total energy. The excitation energies associated with SDW formation are within the range of thermal energies even well below the Néel temperature. Structural relaxation of the SDW reveals that the stress relaxation has no significant effect on the energetics of the SDW phase.

Here we have studied the protein from Azotobacter vinelandii and Klebsiella pneumoniae with Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies, with the following results: when the MoFe protein is oxidized by addition of stoichiometric amounts (6-8 equivalents) of dissolved thionin, the well characterized P-cluster state Pox results. Pox has an as yet undetermined, but half-integer electronic spin; however, the state is EPR-silent. In contrast, oxidation by addition of a large excess of solid thionin powder, the method used by Hagen et al., yields mixtures with variable proportions of two oxidized P-cluster forms, namely the familiar Pox and the new state Pox(S = 7/2) observed by Hagen et al. The Mössbauer data suggest that Pox and Pox(S = 7/2) are isoelectronic. The two states, however, have distinct electronic structures; the Mössbauer spectra of Pox exhibit the characteristic trapped-valence Fe2+ site, whereas the spectra of Pox(S = 7/2) lack this feature. Hagen et al. have proposed two new P-cluster models. We conclude that one of the models is incompatible with the Mössbauer data and that the basic assumptions of the other model are not supported by the available data. Finally, the Mössbauer data show that either oxidation method puts the cofactor centers into the diamagnetic state Mox.},

Solid-state effects have been included using the Watson sphere model for ionic solids. The self-consistency contributions γ∞(1) are found to be in general less than 30\% of the zero-order antishielding factor γ∞(0). The net free ionic γ∞(=γ∞(0)+γ∞(1)) results agree very well with the results of corresponding coupled Hartree-Fock and polarized orbital calculations wherever available. For negative ions, γ∞(0) decreases significantly in going from the free ion to the solid state. For positive ions the opposite holds good. The solid-state effect on γ∞(0) is usually more important than the consistency effects γ∞(1) for the negative ions. For positive ions, the two effects are comparable except in some cases where the consistency effects are larger in magnitude. These trends in the relative importance of γ∞(1) as compared to solid-state effects are discussed in terms of the relative changes in the respective radial charge-density distributions in going from free ions to solid state. The possible influence of many-body correlations effects on γ∞ is considered. Finally, the utility of the γ∞ obtained in the present work for the net field gradients in ionic crystals, for which overlap and covalency effects between immediate neighbors have also to be considered, is discussed.},

Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

	abstract = {A macroscopic treatment of solvated ion dynamics is developed and applied to calculate the limiting (zero concentration) conductance of cations in several aprotic solvents. The theory is based on a coupled set of electrostatic and hydrodynamic equations for the density, flow, and polarization fields induced in the polar solvent by a moving ion. These equations, which are derived by the Mori projection technique, include crucial local solvent structure (ion solvation) effects through solvent compressibility, and local constitutive parameters. If solvent structure is suppressed, the equations reduce to those derived previously by Onsager and Hubbard [J. B. Hubbard and L. Onsager, J. Chem. Phys. 67, 4850 (1977)]. The macroscopic equations are approximately decoupled into electrostatic and hydrodynamic parts. The decoupled equations are solved assuming a step density, viscosity, and dielectric constant model for the local solvent structure and dynamics. This yields analytic expressions for the viscous, ζV, and dielectric ζD, contributions to the ion friction coefficient. These expressions generalize, respectively, the Stokes and Zwanzig results for the (slip) viscous and dielectric friction so as to account for ion solvation effects. The friction coefficients involve a desolvation function Δ which depends on the local structure (density) and dynamics of the solvent. The drag coefficient results reduce in form to those of Zwanzig (within a flow gradient correction factor of 2/3) and Stokes for both weak (Δ→1) and strong (Δ→0) ion–solvent interaction. For Δ→1 the true ionic radius Ri appears in the drag formulas while for Δ→0 a renormalized solvated ion radius σ=Ri+2Rs (where Rs=solvent molecule radius) appears. The theory is fit to experimental cation conductances in pyridine, acetone, and acetonitrile by representing Δ by a two parameter switching function. Agreement between the model and experiment is satisfactory for all three solvents. Moreover dielectric friction is found to have a negligible effect on ion mobility in these solvents.},

Our results show that, in the context of interfacial systems in confinement, the reaction time can be minimized as a function of the desorption rate from the surface, which puts forward a general mechanism of enhancement and regulation of chemical and biological reactivity.},

	abstract = {The multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) method is a method for determining the effective potential energy function for a coarse-grained (CG) model of a system using the data obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of the corresponding atomically detailed model. The MS-CG method, as originally formulated for systems at constant volume, has previously been given a rigorous statistical mechanical basis for the canonical ensemble. Here, we propose and test a version of the MS-CG method suitable for the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The method shows how to construct an effective potential energy function for a CG system that generates the correct volume fluctuations as well as correct distribution functions in the configuration space of the CG sites. The formulation of the method requires introduction of an explicitly volume dependent term in the potential energy function of the CG system. The theory is applicable to simulations with isotropic volume fluctuations and cases where both the atomistic and CG models do not have any intramolecular constraints, but it is straightforward to extend the theory to more general cases. The present theory deals with systems that have short ranged interactions. (The extension to Coulombic forces using Ewald methods requires additional considerations.) We test the theory for constant pressure MS-CG simulations of a simple model of a solution. We show that both the volume dependent and the coordinate dependent parts of the potential are transferable to larger systems than the one used to obtain these potentials.},

	abstract = {A computational approach is developed to quantitatively study the solvation thermodynamics of amino acid analogues in ionic liquids via molecular simulation. The solvation thermodynamics of amino acid analogues in ionic liquids is important for an understanding of protein-ionic liquid interactions, shedding insight into the structure and solubility of proteins, and the activity of enzymes in ionic liquids. This information is additionally key to developing novel extraction processes. As a result of the challenge of quantitatively describing the solvation behavior of ionic liquids, a key outcome of the present study is the development of a “hydrophobicity” scale to quantitatively describe the amino acid analogues. The scale allows one to separate the results of both the hydrophobic and hydrophillic analogues, simplifying an understanding of the observed trends. Equipped with the proposed hydrophobicity scale, one needs only perform conventional solvation free energy calculations of the amino acid analogues in the ionic liquids of interest. The necessary simulation tools are available in most open-source simulation software, facilitating the adoption of this approach by the simulation community at large. We have studied the case of varying the cation alkyl-chain length of a 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation paired with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion. The findings suggest that a judicious selection of both the cation and anion could potentially lead to a solvent for which the amino acid analogues have an affinity far greater than that for both water and a non-polar reference solvent.},

A notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in understanding charge storage mechanisms and the development of advanced nanostructured materials. The discovery that ion desolvation occurs in pores smaller than the solvated ions has led to higher capacitance for electrochemical double layer capacitors using carbon electrodes with subnanometre pores, and opened the door to designing high-energy density devices using a variety of electrolytes. Combination of pseudo-capacitive nanomaterials, including oxides, nitrides and polymers, with the latest generation of nanostructured lithium electrodes has brought the energy density of electrochemical capacitors closer to that of batteries. The use of carbon nanotubes has further advanced micro-electrochemical capacitors, enabling flexible and adaptable devices to be made.

	abstract = {A molecular theory of collective orientational relaxation of dipolar molecules in a dense liquid is presented. Our work is based on a generalized, nonlinear, Smoluchowski equation (GSE) that includes the effects of intermolecular interactions through a mean‐field force term. The effects of translational motion of the liquid molecules on the orientational relaxation is also included self‐consistently in the GSE. Analytic expressions for the wave‐vector‐dependent orientational correlation functions are obtained for one component, pure liquid and also for binary mixtures. We find that for a dipolar liquid of spherical molecules, the correlation function ϕ(k,t) for l=1, where l is the rank of the spherical harmonics, is biexponential. At zero wave‐vector, one time constant becomes identical with the dielectric relaxation time of the polar liquid. The second time constant is the longitudinal relaxation time, but the contribution of this second component is small. We find that polar forces do not affect the higher order correlation functions (l{\textgreater}1) of spherical dipolar molecules in a linearized theory. The expression of ϕ(k,t) for a binary liquid is a sum of four exponential terms. We also find that the wave‐vector‐dependent relaxation times depend strongly on the microscopic structure of the dense liquid. At intermediate wave vectors, the translational diffusion greatly accelerates the rate of orientational relaxation. The present study indicates that one must pay proper attention to the microscopic structure of the liquid while treating the translational effects. An analysis of the nonlinear terms of the GSE is also presented. An interesting coupling between the number density fluctuation and the orientational fluctuation is uncovered.},

	abstract = {In order to understand basic principles of the double layer formation in room temperature ionic liquids, we have performed Molecular Dynamic simulations for a simplified system: dense assembly of charged Lennard-Jones spheres between charged walls. For simplicity, in this first investigation we have considered the cations and anions of the same size. We have calculated the corresponding values of the double layer capacitance as a function of the electrode potential and compared the results with existing theories. We have found that the capacitance curve does not follow the U-shape of the Gouy–Chapman theory, but has a bell-shape in agreement with the mean-field theory that takes into account the effect of limited maximum packing of ions. The wings of capacitance decrease inversely proportional to the square root of the electrode potential, as prescribed by the mean-field theory and the charge conservation law at large electrode polarizations. We have found, however, that the mean-field theory does not quantitatively reproduce the simulation results at small electrode potentials, having detected their remarkable overscreening effects (ionic correlations). The plots for the distributions of ions near the electrode at different electrode charges show that for the considered system, unlike it is often assumed, the double layer is not one layer thick. The overscreening effects, dominating near the potential of zero charge (p.z.c.), are suppressed by the high electrode polarizations, following the onset of the so-called ‘lattice saturation effect’. The maximum of the capacitance coincides with the p.z.c., but it is true only for this ‘symmetric’ system. If sizes of cations and anions are different the maximum will be shifted away from the p.z.c., and generally the shape of the capacitance curve could be more complicated.},

The methodology consists of utilizing a micromolar concentration of the common dye fluorescein, whose fluorescence in solution strongly increases above pH 6.2, in order to map the pH changes in the central jet stream where an acid?base reaction proceeds. This experimental method has been calibrated thanks to a theoretical study. The latter was based on a numerical solution of ion transport equations in solution which takes proper account of the electrostatic and chemical phenomena. The experimental fluorescence profiles determined by CLSM have been found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions and to be highly sensitive to both the initial bulk solution pH and the applied volumetric rate ratio (α) of the outer stream to the inner stream. The simulated pH gradients have been compared for different α. This latter has been tuned during the synthesis of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles in order to study its effect on the produced nanoparticles in terms of particles mean size, size distribution, and yield in magnetic material.},

Rather, six-, five- and four-coordinate Al3+ ions are found. Furthermore, evidence is presented for a tendency of the different coordinate species to spatially separate, and it is suggested that Al2O3 is close to a liquid?liquid phase separation of the type recently discussed by Angell and co-workers (ACS Symp.

In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the local environment of Y as an exemplary trace element in four silicate melts with different compositions and thus varying degrees of polymerization. Based on these structural results, we propose a mechanism which explains the observed partitioning trends of Y and other rare-earth elements between crystals and melts or between two melts. With our computational approach, we found a systematic correlation between melt composition and Y coordination as well as Y―O bond lengths, a result which was corroborated by EXAFS spectroscopy on glasses with the same compositions as the simulated melts. Our simulations revealed, moreover, the affinity of Y for network modifiers as second-nearest neighbors (Ca in this study) and the tendency to avoid network formers (Si and Al). This is consistent with the observation that Y (and other rare-earth elements) in general prefer depolymerized to polymerized melts in partitioning experiments (see, e.g., Schmidt et al. (2006)). Furthermore, we used the method of thermodynamic integration to calculate the Gibbs free energy which governs Y partitioning between two exemplary melts. These more quantitative results, too, are in line with the observed partitioning trends.},

Density, hydrogen bonding properties, and residence times of water molecules were projected on two-dimensional planes providing a spatial description of water behavior. We found that the average water density is significantly depleted relative to bulk value. A detailed analysis of pocket occupancy revealed fluctuations between states of completely empty pocket and a pocket filled with a bulklike fluid, which seem to result from collective behavior of water molecules. Free energy differences accompanying these fluctuations are rather small, suggesting that the given pocket radius is close to the critical one for transition between gas and liquid phases in the considered system. We show that the situation is different in the case of a simple Lennard-Jones fluid. These results indicate that changing the surface curvature from flat to concave may lead to qualitative difference in water behavior in its vicinity. We think that our studies may also put some light on binding site desolvation process which is necessary to understand to make correct predictions of binding energies.},

The predictions for the chlorinated biphenyls show a systematic shift of approximately 1 kcal/mol, but the large RMSE of 1.59 kcal/mol mainly arises from two exceptional outliers.

However, to be as useful as its Cartesian counterpart, a polar version of the Fourier operational toolset is required for the standard operations of shift, multiplication, convolution, etc. This paper derives the requisite polar version of the standard Fourier operations. In particular, convolution--two dimensional, circular, and radial one dimensional--is discussed in detail. It is shown that standard multiplication/convolution rules do apply as long as the correct definition of convolution is applied.},

We employ a simple set of tight-binding parameters that accurately describes electronic structure and energetics, and show these to be transferable between first row transition metals and their alloys. We make a number of calculations of the electronic structure of dilute Cr impurities in Fe, which we compare with results using the local spin density approximation. The fixed moment model provides a powerful means for interpreting complex magnetic configurations in alloys; using this approach, we are able to advance a simple and readily understood explanation for the observed anomaly in the enthalpy of mixing.},

This result lends considerable support to the belief in the Ising model as a valid first approximation for such systems.},

Both the pair distribution functiong(12) and the direct correlation functionc(12) consist of a spherically symmetric term and two other terms with different dependences on the orientations of the two dipole moments. The spherically symmetric part is the solution of the Percus‐Yevick equation for hard spheres. The angle‐dependent terms satisfy two coupled integral equations, which can be decoupled by appropriate changes of the dependent variables. The solutions are expressed in terms of the solution of the Percus‐Yevick equation for hard spheres for both positive and negative densities. The effect on g(12) of the finite size of the sample is calculated for the case of a sphere. The correction term in g(12) is found to be of order 1/V, where V is the volume of the sample. It is a function not only of the relative distance vector of the two molecules, but also of their positions in the sample. The contribution to the polarization is, nevertheless, constant throughout the sample, in agreement with classical electrostatics. The dielectric constant ε, calculated by Kirkwood\&apos;s formula, is obtained in closed form. It is a function of a single variable which does not contain the hard sphere diameter.},

Then, we have derived a natural orbital functional, the Piris Natural Orbital Functional 5, PNOF5, constrained to fulfill the D, Q, and G positivity necessary conditions of the N-representable 2-RDM. This functional yields a remarkable accurate description of systems bearing substantial (near)degeneracy of one-particle states. The theory is applied to the homolitic dissociation of selected diatomic molecules and to the rotation barrier of ethylene, both paradigmatic cases of near-degeneracy effects. It is found that the method describes correctly the dissociation limit yielding an integer number of electrons on the dissociated atoms. PNOF5 predicts a barrier of 65.6 kcal/mol for the ethylene torsion in an outstanding agreement with Complete Active Space Second-order Perturbation Theory (CASPT2). The obtained occupation numbers and pseudo one-particle energies at the ethylene transition state account for fully degenerate π orbitals. The calculated equilibrium distances, dipole moments, and binding energies of the considered molecules are presented. The values obtained are accurate comparing those obtained by the complete active space self-consistent field method and the experimental data.},

	abstract = {The diffusion coefficients of ions and of uncharged solutes in aqueous solution at 25 °C and at infinite dilution are studied by computer simulation using the SPC/E model for water and solute?water potentials employed in previous work (Koneshan, S.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. 1998, 102, 4193?4204). The mobilities of the ions calculated from the diffusion coefficients pass through a maximum as a function of ion size, with distinct curves and maximums for positive and negative ions in qualitative agreement with experiment. We aim to understand this at a microscopic level in terms of theoretical studies of the friction coefficient ?, which is related to diffusion coefficient by the Stokes?Einstein relation. This provides one method of calculating ?, but it can also be obtained in principle from the random force autocorrelation function which is the starting point of molecular theories of the friction. Molecular and continuum theories divide the friction into hydrodynamic and dielectric components calculated in different ways on the basis of certain approximations that are tested in this paper. The two methods of determining ? give consistent results in simulations of large ions or uncharged solutes but differ by a factor of nearly 1.5 for smaller ions. This is attributed to the assumption, in our simulations and in some molecular theories, that the random force autocorrelation function of a moving ion can be approximated by the total force autocorrelation function of a fixed ion but the observed trends in ? with ion size are unchanged. Three different separations of the force autocorrelation function are studied; namely, partitioning this into (a) electrostatic and Lennard-Jones forces (b) hard and soft forces, and (c) forces arising from the first shell and more distant forces. The cross-terms are found to be significant in all cases, and the contributions of the sum of the soft term and the cross-terms, which are of opposite sign, to the total friction in the hard?soft separation, is small for all the ions (large and small). This suggests that dielectric friction calculated using this separation, with the neglect of cross-terms, is less accurate than previously supposed and the success of these theories is due to a cancellation of errors in the approximations. This is supported by recent a theoretical study of Chong and Hirata (Chong, C.; Hirata, F. J. Chem. Phys. 1998, 108, 739) which evaluates the cross-terms. A phenomenological theory due to Chen and Adelman (Chen, J. H.; Adelman, S. A. J. Chem. Phys. 1980, 72, 2819) calculates the friction in terms of effective hydrodynamic and dielectric radii for the ions (cf. solventberg picture) and predicts low dielectric friction for large ions and small strongly solvated ions. This also agrees qualitatively with our simulations but a complete molecular theory, applicable to positive and negative ions in hydrogen-bonded solvents such as water, has yet to be developed.},

Our simulation results showed that hydrogen-bonding properties such as the average number of hydrogen bonds and their lifetime distributions were nearly constant at all concentrations between infinite dilution and the solubility limit. This implies that the characterization of urea?water solutions in the molarity concentration scale as nearly ideal is a result of facile local hydrogen bonding rather than a global property. Thus, urea concentration does not influence the local propensity for hydrogen bonds, only how they are satisfied. By comparison, the KBFF model of urea donated fewer hydrogen bonds than OPLS. We found that the KBFF urea model in TIP3P water better reproduced the experimental density and diffusion constant data. Preferential solvation analysis showed that there were weak urea?urea and water?water associations in OPLS solution at short distances, but there were no strong associations. We divided urea molecules into large, medium, and small clusters to examine fluctuation properties and found that any particular urea molecule did not stay in the same cluster for a long time. We found neither persistent nor large clusters.},

Structural and energetic quantities were collected over 90-ps simulations and compared between models and among solutes; the proximity criterion was used to divide the water into mutually exclusive sets for analysis. Overall, the agreement with previous studies and between the SPC/E and POL3 models is substantial. Results suggest that the structure of water is preserved, rather than enhanced, around hydrophobic groups and that waters hydrogen-bonding to polar solute groups sacrifice solvent?solvent interactions to some degree. Solute methyl groups are not uniformly hydrophobic; as expected, their polarity and the surrounding solvent structure depend on the neighboring functional groups.},

	abstract = {Relaxation at simple metal surfaces is studied via minimization of the total energy of a semi-infinite crystal. The expression for the total energy depends explicitly on the ionic positions, and is based on the use of pseudopotential theory and linear response. Electron screening is treated self-consistently including exchange and correlation effects. From a systematic investigation of the energetics underlying metal surface relaxation, for the low-index surfaces of bcc Na and fcc Al it is concluded that to achieve quantitative surface structural predictions requires the use of the full total-energy expression for the semi-infinite solid. Such an expression must maintain the three-dimensional nature of the system and account properly for the inhomogeneous surface electron density and the self-consistent response of the electron system to the ionic positions (screening). Multilayer relaxation is shown to be essential for quantitative structural predictions and the origins of the phenomena are discussed in detail demonstrating the relative effects of electrostatic terms and band-structure contributions. The results exhibit damped oscillatory multilayer relaxations (the relaxation being particularly pronounced for the open faces) with a period equal to the bulk layer stacking period and agree well with available structural determinations obtained via the analysis of experimental data.},

	abstract = {In order to explore the various possible property trends in ionic liquid mixtures, five different ionic liquids were mixed with N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([C3mpyr][NTf2]), and the viscosities, excess molar volumes, ionic conductivities, and phase diagrams of the mixtures were determined over a range of temperatures. In a number of the mixtures the crystallization of both components was completely suppressed and no melting point was observable. Such mixtures of similar ionic liquids thus have potential for use in low-temperature applications by extending the liquid range to Tg. The molar conductivities and viscosities are described as approximating predictable or ?simple? mixing behaviors, while excess molar volumes were found to show a variety of mixing and nonideal mixing effects. Mixture equations for viscosity and conductivity are discussed and analyzed. An immiscibility window was observed in the trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([P6,6,6,14][NTf2]) in the [C3mpyr][NTf2] system in the [C3mpyr][NTf2]-rich region. Unusual physical properties are exhibited by miscible compositions near the demixing line. These compositions are described as [P6,6,6,14][NTf2]-like, even up to 0.5 mol fraction of [C3mpyr][NTf2].},

	abstract = {We report a Lattice-Boltzmann scheme that accounts for adsorption and desorption in the calculation of mesoscale dynamical properties of tracers in media of arbitrary complexity. Lattice Boltzmann simulations made it possible to solve numerically the coupled Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and Nernst-Planck equations of electrokinetics in complex, heterogeneous media. With the moment propagation scheme, it became possible to extract the effective diffusion and dispersion coefficients of tracers, or solutes, of any charge, e.g., in porous media. Nevertheless, the dynamical properties of tracers depend on the tracer-surface affinity, which is not purely electrostatic and also includes a species-specific contribution. In order to capture this important feature, we introduce specific adsorption and desorption processes in a lattice Boltzmann scheme through a modified moment propagation algorithm, in which tracers may adsorb and desorb from surfaces through kinetic reaction rates. The method is validated on exact results for pure diffusion and diffusion-advection in Poiseuille flows in a simple geometry. We finally illustrate the importance of taking such processes into account in the time-dependent diffusion coefficient in a more complex porous medium.},

The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. Different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties.

Non-self consistent calculations employing non-collinear quantisation axes have been presented before; the present calculations are, they believe, distinguished by: first, being self-consistent; second, providing the total energy; and third, providing the spin-quantisation axes. In their first applications they deal with the non-collinear antiferromagnets gamma -FeMn, RhMn 3 , and PtMn 3 and show that their total energies are minimised in the tetrahedral (FeMn) or triangular (RhMn 3 , PtMn 3 ) magnetic structures first proposed by Kouvel and Kasper (1963).},

The requisite averages over the ISM fluids are calculated by the extended reference interaction site method (XRISM) using site–site hypernetted chain (HNC)‐like closures modified to reproduce the correct long‐range behavior of the site–site pair correlation functions. They are compared with averages over the ΩM models under the RHNC theory taken from the literature or calculated under the mean spherical approximation. We find for fluids of strong enough polarity that ϵL(k) is negative over a finite range of k, the low end being in agreement with recent computer simulation studies of both ISM and ΩM polar fluids. However, we confirm that the expected large‐k behavior ϵL(k)=1 governs the ISMs, but not the ΩM models. Based on an adaptation of the color charge–color field techniques of molecular dynamics, we develop the concept of the color longitudinal dielectric function; it provides useful information about the role of the spatial extent of the molecular charge distribution on the behavior of ϵL(k). The ISM fluids we have analyzed include dipolar dumbbells over a wide range of bond length and polarity as well as realistic interaction site models for water and methanol. For the methanol model, we compare our ϵL(k) with recent computer simulation results and find substantial agreement.},

	abstract = {We present a combined molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory investigation of the nuclear magnetic shielding constant of the 113Cd(II) ion solvated in aqueous solution. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out for the cadmium?water system in order to produce instantaneous geometries for subsequent determination of the nuclear magnetic shielding constant at the density functional theory level. The nuclear magnetic shielding constant is computed using a perturbation theory formalism, which includes nonrelativistic and leading order relativistic contributions to the nuclear magnetic shielding tensor. Although the NMR shielding constant varies significantly with respect to simulation time, the value averaged over increasing number of snapshots remains almost constant. The paramagnetic nonrelativistic contribution is found to be most sensitive to dynamical changes in the system and is mainly responsible for the thermal and solvent effects in solution. The relativistic correction features very little sensitivity to the chemical environment, and can be disregarded in theoretical calculations when a Cd complex is used as reference compound in 113Cd NMR experiments, due to the mutual cancelation between individual relativistic corrections.},

The question of metal- versus ligand-centered oxidation in high-valent transition metal complexes is also a challenging one for DFT calculations, as I have tried to illustrate with examples from among porphyrin, corrole, biliverdine, and NO complexes. In a number of cases, I have compared results obtained with different exchange–correlation functionals; in addition, I have added a discussion on the relative performance of pure versus hybrid functionals. Finally, I have offered some thoughts on the role that traditional wavefunction-based ab initio methods, now essentially absent from the bioinorganic arena, might play in the future.},

	abstract = {Limiting ionic conductance (?0) of rigid symmetrical unipositive ions in aqueous solution shows a strong temperature dependence. For example, ?0 more than doubles when the temperature is increased from 283 to 318 K. A marked variation also occurs when the solvent is changed from ordinary water (H2O) to heavy water (D2O). In addition, ?0 shows a nonmonotonic size dependence with a skewed maximum near Cs+. Although these important results have been known for a long time, no satisfactory theoretical explanation exists for these results. In this article we present a simple molecular theory which provides a nearly quantitative explanation in terms of microscopic structure and dynamics of the solvent. A notable feature of this theory is that it does not invoke any nonquantifiable models involving solvent-berg or clatherates. We find the strong temperature dependence of ?0 to arise from a rather large number of microscopic factors, each providing a small but nontrivial contribution, but all acting surprisingly in the same direction. This work, we believe, provides, for the first time, a satisfactory explanation of both the anomalous size and temperature dependencies of ?0 of unipositive ions in molecular terms. The marked change in ?0 as the solvent is changed from H2O to D2O is found to arise partly from a change in the dielectric relaxation and partly from a change in the effective interaction of the ion with the solvent.},

	abstract = {A specific methodology was developed to collate the interlayer configurations resulting from Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with experimental X-ray and neutron diffraction data for two synthetic Na-saturated saponites having contrasting layer charge. Numerical simulations were performed assuming different existing sets of atomic partial charge and Lennard-Jones parameters for clay and water. For each parameter set and for the two samples in both the mono- and bihydrated states, the water contents resulting from GCMC simulations were first compared to water vapor desorption gravimetry data. The density distributions of interlayer species were then used to generate 00l intensities that were compared to X-ray and neutron diffraction data, the latter being recorded on both hydrogenated and deuterated specimens. The CLAYFF model [Cygan et al. J. Phys. Chem. B2004, 108, 1255] is shown to better account for water content and organization compared to the model developed by Skipper et al. (Clays Clay Miner.1995, 43, 285) and modified by Smith (Langmuir1998, 14, 5959). However, diffraction patterns calculated for bihydrated samples from CLAYFF simulations did not match satisfactorily the diffraction data. Lennard-Jones parameters were thus modified for oxygen atoms from the clay layer. When combined with the SPC/E water model, this modified version of CLAYFF allows matching experimental water contents and fitting the complete set of diffraction data. Relevant information may thus be derived on the influence of layer charge on the orientational properties of interlayer water molecules which differs for the different clay models. Finally, the approach used in the present study proved powerful for assessing atomic interaction parameters considered for computational simulations.},

Accurate and precise measurements of ion diffusion coefficients were obtained using steady-state electrochemistry to determine the flux and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to measure the PEMU concentration. It was found that the concentration of ferricyanide inside the film decreased with temperature. Membrane transport is strongly thermally activated with activation energy 98 kJ mol?1. A potential shift with decreasing salt concentration in cyclic voltammograms was translated into a differential flux caused by significantly higher diffusion coefficients for ferricyanide as compared to ferrocyanide.},

The heat of sublimation at 298°K is 94.0 keal/g-atom, the boiling point is estimated to be 2680°C.
The chromium pressures in the system chromium-iron have been measured at 1340°-1370°C for various compositions. The activity curve shows some positive deviation from Raoult's line.
Assuming the solid and liquid solutions to be regular, and using thermal data for the minimum in the liquidus curve and the maximum of the [sigma]-[alpha] transformation together with Backhurst's atomic heat data for this transformation, the phase boundaries, [alpha]-liquid and [alpha]-[sigma], have been calculated and found to agree essentially with the experimental phase diagram. The solidus-liquidus gap was, however, found to be narrower than hitherto assumed, and the [alpha]-[sigma] boundary has been extended to lower temperatures.},

that we are in Taylor’s regime i.e. we deal with dominant Peclet num-
bers. In contrast to the classical work of Taylor, we undertake a rigorous
derivation of the upscaled hyperbolic dispersion equation. Hyper-
bolic effective models were proposed by several authors and our goal is
to confirm rigorously the effective equations derived by Balakotaiah et
al in recent years using a formal Liapounov - Schmidt reduction. Our
analysis uses the Laplace transform in time and an anisotropic singular
perturbation technique, the small characteristic parameter ε being the ra-
tio between the thickness and the longitudinal observation length. The
P ́clet number is written as Cε−α , with α {\textless} 2. Hyperbolic effective
e
model corresponds to a high P ́clet number close to the threshold value
e
when Taylor’s regime turns to turbulent mixing and we characterize it by
supposing 4/3 {\textless} α {\textless} 2. We prove that the difference between the dimen-
sionless physical concentration and the effective concentration, calculated
using the hyperbolic upscaled model, divided by ε2−α (the local P ́clet
e
number) converges strongly to zero in L2 -norm. For P ́clet numbers con-
e
sidered in this paper, the hyperbolic dispersion equation turns out to give
a better approximation than the classical parabolic Taylor model.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that ferritic and ferritic/martensitic steels develop much less swelling than austenitic steels during neutron or charged particle irradiation. The prevailing assumption is usually that the steady-state swelling rate of bcc steels is inherently much lower than that of fcc steels, at least a factor of ten or more. It is shown in this paper that this perception is incorrect, with bcc steels having steady-state swelling rates perhaps only a factor two to four lower. It is thought to be significant that the creep compliance of the two types of alloys also differs only by a factor of about two. The lower swelling observed in bcc steels relative to fcc steels is shown in this paper to be primarily a consequence of much longer transient regimes prior to the onset of steady-state swelling. Several other commonly held perceptions concerning the swelling of both bcc and fcc steels are examined in this paper and also shown to require revision. These involve the effect of cold-work on swelling, the extent of the temperature regime of swelling, and the possibility that swelling might saturate eventually. It also appears that the use of well-controlled in-reactor materials tests that employ active temperature control tend to yield significantly lower values of void swelling compared to that obtained under more representative conditions typical of actual reactor operation. The role of previously ignored differences in displacement rate to determine the duration of the transient regime of void swelling is also shown to require reevaluation, especially for bcc steels.},

Unfortunately, the customary introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics, especially the idea of switching between different independent variables. The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r) by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform from the chemical potential ({\textbackslash}mu) to the number of particles (N). This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived. The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

With the atomistic pair direct correlation functions of the uniform system calculated from MD simulation and an analytical expression for the bridge functional from the modified fundamental measure theory, the SDFT can be used to predict the structure and thermodynamic properties of water under inhomogeneous conditions with a computational cost negligible in comparison to that of brute-force simulations. The numerical performance of the SDFT has been demonstrated with the predictions of the solvation free energies of 15 molecular analogs of amino acid side chains in water represented by SPC/E, SPC, and TIP3P models. For theTIP3P model, a comparison of the theoretical predictions with MD simulation and experimental data shows agreement within 0.64 and 1.09 kcal/mol on average, respectively.},

	abstract = {New models of fluid transport are expected to emerge from the confinement of liquids at the nanoscale, with potential applications in ultrafiltration, desalination and energy conversion. Nevertheless, advancing our fundamental understanding of fluid transport on the smallest scales requires mass and ion dynamics to be ultimately characterized across an individual channel to avoid averaging over many pores. A major challenge for nanofluidics thus lies in building distinct and well-controlled nanochannels, amenable to the systematic exploration of their properties. Here we describe the fabrication and use of a hierarchical nanofluidic device made of a boron nitride nanotube that pierces an ultrathin membrane and connects two fluid reservoirs. Such a transmembrane geometry allows the detailed study of fluidic transport through a single nanotube under diverse forces, including electric fields, pressure drops and chemical gradients. Using this device, we discover very large, osmotically induced electric currents generated by salinity gradients, exceeding by two orders of magnitude their pressure-driven counterpart. We show that this result originates in the anomalously high surface charge carried by the nanotube/'s internal surface in water at large pH, which we independently quantify in conductance measurements. The nano-assembly route using nanostructures as building blocks opens the way to studying fluid, ionic and molecule transport on the nanoscale, and may lead to biomimetic functionalities. Our results furthermore suggest that boron nitride nanotubes could be used as membranes for osmotic power harvesting under salinity gradients.},

	abstract = {We report development of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method that can use active space scalable to much larger size references than has previously been possible. The recent development of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method in multireference quantum chemistry offers the ability to describe static correlation in a large active space. The present MRCI method provides a critical correction to the DMRG reference by including high-level dynamic correlation through the CI treatment. When the DMRG and MRCI theories are combined (DMRG-MRCI), the full internal contraction of the reference in the MRCI ansatz, including contraction of semi-internal states, plays a central role. However, it is thought to involve formidable complexity because of the presence of the five-particle rank reduced-density matrix (RDM) in the Hamiltonian matrix elements. To address this complexity, we express the Hamiltonian matrix using commutators, which allows the five-particle rank RDM to be canceled out without any approximation. Then we introduce an approximation to the four-particle rank RDM by using a cumulant reconstruction from lower-particle rank RDMs. A computer-aided approach is employed to derive the exceedingly complex equations of the MRCI in tensor-contracted form and to implement them into an efficient parallel computer code. This approach extends to the size-consistency-corrected variants of MRCI, such as the MRCI+Q, MR-ACPF, and MR-AQCC methods. We demonstrate the capability of the DMRG-MRCI method in several benchmark applications, including the evaluation of single-triplet gap of free-base porphyrin using 24 active orbitals.},

In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the expression of the free-energy functional relies on the direct correlation function of the pure solvent. To obtain that function as exactly as possible for a given atomistic solvent model, we propose the following approach: first to perform molecular simulations of the homogeneous solvent and compute the position and angle-dependent two-body distribution functions, and then to invert the Ornstein-Zernike relation using a finite rotational invariant basis set to get the corresponding direct correlation function. This rather natural scheme is proved, for the first time to our knowledge, to be valuable for a dipolar solvent involving long range interactions. The resulting solvent free-energy functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional grid around a solute to get the solvent particle and polarization density profiles and solvation free energies. The viability of this approach is proven in a comparison with “exact” molecular dynamics calculations for the simple test case of spherical ions in a dipolar solvent.},

	abstract = {The NMR pulsed magnetic field gradient stimulated echo technique of Tanner is especially useful for measuring the translational diffusion coefficient, D, of the resonant nucleus in materials where T1 ⪢ T2. However, in heterogeneous systems having components with dissimilar magnetic susceptibilities, a distribution of background gradients, g0, may cause excessive signal (echo) attenuation and a systematic error in the measurement of D. Three new stimulated echo sequences involving applied field gradient pulses, of amplitude ga, together with RF pulses, are described. For all of these sequences the echo attenuation and systematic error caused by g0 and g0ga terms, respectively, are greatly reduced. For one of the sequences, this reduction can be realized with gradient pulses of a single polarity. With bipolar (alternating) gradient pulses the cross term can be made to vanish, with the correct choice of conditions, for all three of the sequences. Two of the new sequences have been tested experimentally by means of D measurements involving 1H signals in bulk glycerol (homogeneous) and in granular TaH0.73 (heterogeneous) samples.},

Analytic expressions for the electroosmotic mobility and the total mobility are derived that are in good agreement with the numerical results. The relevant quantity characterizing the effect of slippage is found to be the dimensionless quantity ??δB, where δB is the slip length, and ??1 is an effective electrostatic screening length at the channel boundaries.},

	abstract = {Meta-benzoquinodimethane (MBQDM) or m-xylylene provides a model for larger organic diradicals, the triplet–singlet gap being the key property. In the present work this energy difference has been the object of a systematic study by means of several density functional theory-based methods including B3LYP, M06, M06-2X, HSE and LC-ωPBE potentials and a variety of wave function-based methods such as complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF), Multireference second-order Møller–Plesset (MRMP), difference dedicated configuration interaction (DDCI), and Multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). In each case various basis sets of increasing quality have been explored, and the effect of the molecular geometry is also analyzed. The use of the triplet and broken symmetry (BS) solutions for the corresponding optimized geometries obtained from B3LYP and especially M06-2X functionals provide the value of the adiabatic triplet–singlet gap closer to experiment when compared to the reported value of Wenthold, Kim, and Lineberger, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 1354) and also for the electron affinity. The agreement further improves using the full π-valence CASSCF(8,8) optimized geometry as an attempt to correct for the spin contamination effects on the geometry of the BS state. The CASSCF, MRMP, and MRCI, even with the full π valence CAS(8,8) as reference and relatively large basis set, systematically overestimate the experimental value indicating either that an accurate description must go beyond this level of theory, including σ electrons and higher order polarization functions, or perhaps that the measured value is affected by the experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {A molecular density functional theory of solvation is presented. The solvation properties of an arbitrary solute in a given solvent, both described by a molecular force field, can be obtained by minimization of a position- and orientation-dependent free-energy density functional. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the unknown excess term of the functional can be approximated by the angular-dependent direct correlation function of the pure solvent. This function can be extracted from a preliminary MD simulation of the pure solvent by computing the angular-dependent pair distribution function and solving subsequently the molecular Ornstein?Zernike equation. The corresponding functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional cubic grid for positions and a Gauss?Legendre angular grid for orientations to provide the solvation free energy of embedded molecules at the same time as the solvent three-dimensional microscopic structure. This functional minimization procedure is much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be also pertinent to the molecular-level determination of electron-transfer properties such as reaction free energy and reorganization energy. It is illustrated for molecular solvation and photochemical electron-transfer reactions in acetonitrile, a prototypical polar aprotic solvent.},

Ab initio calculations of the OH–He PES were carried out using the open-shell single- and double-excitation coupled cluster approach with non-iterative perturbational treatment of triple excitations [RCCSD(T)]. The augmented correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVXZ (X = Q, 5, 6) basis sets were employed, and the energies obtained were then extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. Integral and differential cross sections (ICS and DCS), and thermal rate coefficients for the rotational excitation in OH + He collisions were calculated using the new PES, and compared with available experimental results. Experimental and theoretical results were found to be in a very good agreement. The newly constructed PES reproduces the available experimental results for OH(X2Π, v = 0, 1) + He collisions better than the previously available two-dimensional PESs, which were constructed using a fixed OH bond distance. Our work provides the first RCCSD(T) PES for future anticipated experiments in OH(X2Π, v ≥ 0) + He collisions.},

By carrying out steepest-descent mappings of system configurations onto potential-energy minima, two main conclusions emerge: (1) a temperature-independent inherent structure underlies the liquid phase, just as for ‘‘simple’’ liquids with only pair interactions; (2) the Lindemann melting criterion for the crystal apparently can be supplemented by a freezing criterion for the liquid, where both involve critical values of appropriately defined mean displacements from potential minima.},

The decomposition occurs either via the nucleation and growth mechanism or as spinodal decomposition, depending on the Cr content. However, at low chromium concentrations the alloys are anomalously stable. This is shown to be true only for the ferromagnetic body centered cubic (bcc) phase. The stability stems from the negative mixing enthalpy at low concentrations of chromium. We show that the effect has an electronic origin, that is, it is directly related to variations of the electronic structure in the alloy with concentration. We also demonstrate that the variation in the state density of the majority channel at the Fermi level in the concentration interval below 20 at. \% Cr indicates increasing tendency of the system towards the spinodal decomposition in the system. Moreover, in the equimolar concentration region, significant deviations of the spin up band from its canonical shape are observed, which destabilize the bcc phase.},

	abstract = {Tandem solar cells provide an effective way to harvest a broader spectrum of solar radiation by combining two or more solar cells with different absorption bands. However, for polymer solar cells, the performance of tandem devices lags behind single-layer solar cells mainly due to the lack of a suitable low-bandgap polymer. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient single and tandem polymer solar cells featuring a low-bandgap conjugated polymer (PBDTT-DPP: bandgap, {\textasciitilde}1.44 eV). A single-layer device based on the polymer provides a power conversion efficiency of {\textasciitilde}6\%. When the polymer is applied to tandem solar cells, a power conversion efficiency of 8.62\% is achieved, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest certified efficiency for a polymer solar cell to date.

The methods are presented and demonstrated using S=1/2 and S=1 Heisenberg chains as test cases. The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10−9. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties.},

	abstract = {We present a study on electric double-layer capacitors in organic electrolytes based on symmetrical bulky tetraalkylammonium cations, using activated carbons with adjusted pore size distribution. The results reveal that a close fit of electrode pore size distribution to the size of electrolyte ions can lead to a saturation of the active surface, observable as a decrease in capacitive current beyond the saturation point. This effect arises because of maximum cation loading being reached within the electrolyte voltage window following the trend: the longer the alkyl substituent, the lower the saturation voltage. In contrast, if the pore size distribution presents mostly pores significantly larger than the ion size, the saturation effect is not observed at the expense of the lower surface charge storage. The good correspondence between the maximum charge calculated on the basis of a distorted configuration of cations, Qmax, and the measured one, Qexp, suggests that cations use a wider range of pore sizes than would be possible at their unconfined and undistorted geometries. The saturation of the electrode porosity limits the usable voltage of a supercapacitor system and consequently the deliverable energy and power. In view of optimizing the electrochemical performance, the possibility of such an effect should be considered in adapting the sizes of electrode pores and electrolyte ions.},

	abstract = {The solubility of two ionic salts, namely, KF and NaCl, in water has been calculated by Monte Carlo molecular simulation. Water has been modeled with the extended simple point charge model (SPC/E), ions with the Tosi-Fumi model and the interaction between water and ions with the Smith-Dang model. The chemical potential of the solute in the solution has been computed as the derivative of the total free energy with respect to the number of solute particles. The chemical potential of the solute in the solid phase has been calculated by thermodynamic integration to an Einstein crystal. The solubility of the salt has been calculated as the concentration at which the chemical potential of the salt in the solution becomes identical to that of the pure solid. The methodology used in this work has been tested by reproducing the results for the solubility of KF determined previously by 
Ferrario et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 117, 4947 (2002)]
. For KF, it was found that the solubility of the model is only in qualitative agreement with experiment. The variation of the solubility with temperature for KF has also been studied. For NaCl, the potential model used predicts a solubility in good agreement with the experimental value. The same is true for the hydration chemical potential at infinite dilution. Given the practical importance of solutions of NaCl in water the model used in this work, whereas simple, can be of interest for future studies.},

The observation of layering structures at low T is discussed in relation with the Fisher-Widom line for each model. Although we find no apparent correlation between the amplitude of the oscillatory density decay mode and the approach to TFW, that temperature sets a threshold for the generation of nonmonotonic structures within a fixed distance of the interface. The rapid decay of the oscillatory mode amplitude with T may be interpreted as a result of the capillary wave (CW) damping of strongly structured intrinsic density profiles. The layering in the presence of gravitylike external fields indicate that the effective transverse size which might be built in the DF approximations is around 10±2 molecular diameters; however, that interpretation has to allow for an effectively reduced damping exponent, i.e., an effective surface tension for the CW Hamiltonian which is larger than the value obtained directly from the DF grand-potential minimization.},

We examine the theory resulting from the quadratic truncation of the interaction free energy, and determine the resulting phase diagram for hard dumbbell molecules. The results for short bond lengths are in accord with known trends from experiment and simulation. However, the theory predicts no plastic crystal transition for hard dumbbells with a bond length that might characterize nitrogen, for which the experimental β phase is a plastic crystal.

	abstract = {Key technologies for advanced nuclear systems encompass high temperature structural materials, fast neutron resistant core materials, and specific reactor and power conversion technologies (intermediate heat exchanger, turbo-machinery, high temperature electrolytic or thermo-chemical water splitting processes, etc.). The main requirements for the materials to be used in these reactor systems are dimensional stability under irradiation, whether under stress (irradiation creep or relaxation) or without stress (swelling, growth), an acceptable evolution under ageing of the mechanical properties (tensile strength, ductility, creep resistance, fracture toughness, resilience) and a good behavior in corrosive environments (reactor coolant or process fluid). Other criteria for the materials are their cost to fabricate and to assemble, and their composition could be optimized in order for instance to present low-activation (or rapid desactivation) features which facilitate maintenance and disposal. These requirements have to be met under normal operating conditions, as well as in incidental and accidental conditions. These challenging requirements imply that in most cases, the use of conventional nuclear materials is excluded, even after optimization and a new range of materials has to be developed and qualified for nuclear use. This paper gives a brief overview of various materials that are essential to establish advanced systems feasibility and performance for in pile and out of pile applications, such as ferritic/martensitic steels (9-12\% Cr), nickel based alloys (Haynes 230, Inconel 617, etc.), oxide dispersion strengthened ferritic/martensitic steels, and ceramics (SiC, TiC, etc.). This article gives also an insight into the various natures of R\&D needed on advanced materials, including fundamental research to investigate basic physical and chemical phenomena occurring in normal and accidental operating conditions, lab-scale tests to characterize candidate materials mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, as well as component mock-up tests on technology loops to validate potential applications while accounting for mechanical design rules and manufacturing processes. The selection, assessment and validation of materials necessitate a large number of experiments, involving rare and expensive facilities such as research reactors, hot laboratories or corrosion loops. The modelling and the codification of the behaviour of materials will always involve the use of such technological experiments, but it is of utmost importance to develop also a predictive material science. Finally, the paper stresses the benefit of prospects of multilateral collaboration to join skills and share efforts of R\&D to achieve in the nuclear field breakthroughs on materials that have already been achieved over the past decades in other industry sectors (aeronautics, metallurgy, chemistry, etc.).},

In comparison to a vacuum, we predict that the presence of water has little impact on the adsorption of chloride ions to the oxygen-terminated surface but has a dramatic effect on the binding of hydrogen to that surface.

	abstract = {Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a water desalination technology in which salt ions are removed from brackish water by flowing through a spacer channel with porous electrodes on each side. Upon applying a voltage difference between the two electrodes, cations move to and are accumulated in electrostatic double layers inside the negatively charged cathode and the anions are removed by the positively charged anode. One of the key parameters for commercial realization of CDI is the salt adsorption capacity of the electrodes. State-of-the-art electrode materials are based on porous activated carbon particles or carbon aerogels. Here we report the use for CDI of carbide-derived carbon (CDC), a porous material with well-defined and tunable pore sizes in the sub-nanometer range. When comparing electrodes made with CDC with electrodes based on activated carbon, we find a significantly higher salt adsorption capacity in the relevant cell voltage window of 1.2?1.4 V. The measured adsorption capacity for four materials tested negatively correlates with known metrics for pore structure of the carbon powders such as total pore volume and BET-area, but is positively correlated with the volume of pores of sizes {\textless}1 nm, suggesting the relevance of these sub-nanometer pores for ion adsorption. The charge efficiency, being the ratio of equilibrium salt adsorption over charge, does not depend much on the type of material, indicating that materials that have been identified for high charge storage capacity can also be highly suitable for CDI. This work shows the potential of materials with well-defined sub-nanometer pore sizes for energy-efficient water desalination.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the expectations from classic theories of ion solvation, spectroscopy and computer simulations of the liquid–vapor interface of aqueous electrolyte solutions suggest that ions little larger than a water molecule can prefer to reside near the liquid's surface. Here we advance the view that such affinity originates in a competition between strong opposing forces, primarily due to volume exclusion and dielectric polarization, that are common to all dense polar liquids. We present evidence for this generic mechanism from computer simulations of (i) water and (ii) a Stockmayer fluid near its triple point. In both cases, we show that strong surface enhancement of small ions, obtained by tuning solutes' size and charge, can be accentuated or suppressed by modest changes in either of those parameters. Statistics of solvent polarization, when the ion is held at and above the Gibbs dividing surface, highlight a basic deficiency in conventional models of dielectric response, namely, the neglect of interfacial flexibility. By distorting the solution's boundary, an ion experiences fluctuations in electrostatic potential and in electric field whose magnitudes attenuate much more gradually (as the ion is removed from the liquid phase) than for a quiescent planar interface. As one consequence, the collective responses that determine free energies of solvation can resolve very differently in nonuniform environments than in bulk. We show that this persistence of electric-field fluctuations additionally shapes the sensitivity of solute distributions to ion polarizability.},

Therefore, methods need to be developed to solve this problem. In this paper, a molecular dynamics simulation method is used to predict the self-diffusion coefficient for a simple fluid by using the Green– Kubo relation (VACF) and the Einstein relation (MSD). The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental findings except for an error of about 10\%. The algorithm average of the two methods (AV) reduces the error to 7\%. The relationship of the diffusion coefficient with temperature has also been simulated. According to the simulation data, whose correlation is all above 0.99, the diffusion coefficient agrees well with temperature following the Arrenhius relationship. Activation energy for self-diffusion has been calculated and the result were 1258(VACF), 1272(MSD), and 1265(AV) J/mol separately. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The interactions are incorporated by means of a three-dimensional Fourier image of the direct correlation function that is obtained from the first-order mean-spherical approximation. In order to improve the computational efficiency, we make extensive use of fast Fourier transforms for calculating density convolution integrals. A two-dimensional implementation of the new density functional approach, based on the expansion of the functional around the bulk fluid density, is used to study structure and adsorption of two model fluids in narrow cylindrical pores. We also investigate two methods that improve the accuracy of the theory as compared to the conventional DFT approach, which expands the free energy functional around the bulk fluid density: One a variant of the reference fluid density functional theory used by Gillespie et al. [Phys. Rev. E 68, 031503 (2003)10.1103/PhysRevE.68.031503], and the second a weighted density approach with energy route thermodynamics. Results from these two methods are compared to the conventional approach and also to the results of Monte Carlo simulations.

This set, referred to as the G2 neutral test set, includes the 55 molecules whose atomization energies were used to test Gaussian-2 (G2) theory [J. Chem. Phys. 94, 7221 (1991)] and 93 new molecules. The G2 test set includes 29 radicals, 35 nonhydrogen systems, 22 hydrocarbons, 47 substituted hydrocarbons, and 15 inorganic hydrides. It is hoped that this new test set will provide a means for assessing and improving new theoretical models. From an assessment of G2 and density functional theories(DFT) on this test set it is found that G2 theory is the most reliable method both in terms of average absolute deviation (1.58 kcal/mol) and maximum deviation (8.2 kcal/mol). The largest deviations between experiment and G2 theory occur for molecules having multiple halogens. Inclusion of spin–orbit effects reduces the average absolute deviation to 1.47 kcal/mol and significantly improves the results for the chlorine substituted molecules, but little overall improvement is seen for the fluorine substituted molecules. Of the two modified versions of G2 theory examined in this study, G2(MP2,SVP) theory (average absolute deviation=1.93 kcal/mol) performs better than G2(MP2) theory (2.04 kcal/mol). The G2(MP2,SVP) theory is found to perform very well for hydrocarbons, radicals, and inorganic hydrides. Of the seven DFT methods investigated, the B3LYP method has the smallest average absolute deviation (3.11 kcal/mol). It also has a significantly larger distribution of error than the G2 methods with a maximum deviation of 20.1 kcal/mol.},

The Bain transformation pathway computed, using the proposed model Hamiltonian, for the Fe15Cr alloy configuration is in excellent agreement with ab initio total-energy calculations. Our investigation also shows how the parameters of a tight-binding many-body model Hamiltonian for a magnetic alloy can be derived from the comparison of its mean-field solutions with other, more accurate, mean-field approximations (e.g., density-functional calculations), hence stimulating the development of large-scale computational algorithms for modeling radiation damage effects in magnetic alloys and steels.},

	abstract = {The CASPT2 method, developed by Roos and coworkers, is reviewed. The rationale for a method that can deal with arbitrary strongly correlated systems at affordable computational cost is presented, and the main milestones in the 20-year history of CASPT2 are listed. The basic features of the method are summarized. The strengths and weaknesses of CASPT2 are assessed. Its main strength is its ability to deal with arbitrary electronic states at a reasonable computational cost, and giving exact spin states. Its main limitation is that, it is not a black box method, and requires considerable experience to use. Another limitation is that, for accurate results, the active space must be generally larger than the minimum required to describe only the strong (static) correlation. Including dynamical correlation at an earlier stage may resolve some of these issues. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem 111:3273–3279, 2011},

	abstract = {In recent literatures, it has been presumed from the electric-resistance measurement, the magnetic analysis and the hardness measurement that in the alloy of the composition of atomic ratio 1:1 in Fe-Cr system, a superlattice would be formed, if the alloy is quenched from 1000° and annealed at 500° for a week followed by furnace-cooling.
To ascertain this presumption an X-ray examination was performed. The specimen, which was heat-treated as described above, was X-rayed, Mn-K radiation being used to make the superlattice lines distinct.
The diffraction pattern obtained shows no superlattice lines but only fundamental, where as it is predicted that the superlattice lines would be sufficiently strong to be detectable on the assumption of the superlattice of CsCl type. Therefore, it is concluded that the superlattice of a long range order is not present.},

Biology and biomimetic processes in ionic liquids are also discussed. In these decidedly different materials, some enzymes show activity that is not exhibited in more traditional systems, creating huge potential for bioinspired catalysis and biofuel cells. Our goal in this review is to survey the recent key developments and issues within ionic-liquid research in these areas.

Long-range correction with 100\% HF exchange solves the problem of density functional theory with incorrect chain length dependence of IPs and energy gaps. There is a possibility of overcorrection, if the short-range part of the functional with no or low HF exchange is too small. The wB97XD functional with 22\% of HF exchange in the short-range and a range-separation parameter of 0.2 seems to be just right for conjugated systems at all chain lengths. The wB97XD functional additionally produces negative orbital energies in very good agreement with IPs and EAs. With correct orbital energies, band gaps correspond to transport gaps (Et) and not to optical gaps (Eg). Et is much larger than Eg in the gas phase, but the difference is significantly smaller in the solid state. The accuracy of the negative orbital energies is good down to about 30 eV so that valence and innervalence PE spectra can be modeled. wB97XD is therefore suitable for calculating band structures of conjugated polymers employing orbital energies.},

	abstract = {In order to explore the aqueous acid chemistry of carbonic acid, we employ a constrained ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) technique to study acid dissociations of its three conformers including CC (cis-cis), CT (cis-trans), and TT (trans-trans). The simulations of reagent states reveal similar hydration characteristics for them: the hydroxyls donate H-bonds to solvating waters but no obvious H-bonding exists between hydroxyl oxygen atoms and waters. It is found that the CC conformer dissociates spontaneously to bicarbonate within picoseconds whereas the other two can stay for relatively long simulation times. This suggests that CC has the strongest acidity among the three conformers and it is not stable in water. The simulations indicate that the symmetrical hydroxyls of TT conformer have a pKa value of 3.11 and the two asymmetrical hydroxyls of CT show different pKa values: 2.60 and 3.75, respectively. Overall, these results confirm the recent experimental measurement: about 4.0 for deuterated carbonic acid. By analyzing the dissociation processes, it is revealed that the differences of the acid constants stem from the initial steps of hydroxyls stretches. This simulation study provides a quantitative and microscopic basis for better understanding the reactivity of aqueous carbonate species.},

The theoretical results are found to be in good agreement with the known computer simulation studies for a wide range of solute–solvent size ratio. In addition, the theory can explain the anomalous enhancement of the self-diffusion over the Stokes–Einstein value for small solutes, for the first time. Further, we find that for large solutes the crossover to Stokes–Einstein behavior occurs only when the solute is 2–3 times bigger than the solvent molecules.

	abstract = {Many standard structural quantities, such as order parameters and correlation functions, exist for common condensed matter systems, such as spherical and rod-like particles. However, these structural quantities are often insufficient for characterizing the unique and highly complex structures often encountered in the emerging field of nano and microscale self-assembly, or other disciplines involving complex structures such as computational biology. Computer science algorithms known as “shape matching” methods pose a unique solution to this problem by providing robust metrics for quantifying the similarity between pairs of arbitrarily complex structures. This pairwise matching operation, either implicitly or explicitly, lies at the heart of most standard structural characterization schemes for particle systems. By substituting more robust “shape descriptors” into these schemes we extend their applicability to structures formed from more complex building blocks. Here, we describe several structural characterization schemes and shape descriptors that can be used to obtain various types of structural information about particle systems. We demonstrate the application of shape matching algorithms to a variety of example problems, for topics including local and global structure identification and classification, automated phase diagram mapping, and the construction of spatial and temporal correlation functions. The methods are applicable to a wide range of systems, both simulated and experimental, provided particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.},

The water/mineral interface plays a central role in the dynamics of ions. The ionic mobility in clays is often understood as an interplay between the diffusion of mobile ions and their possible trapping at the mineral surfaces. We describe how to build a two-state diffusion–reaction scheme from the microscopic dynamics of ions, controlled by their interaction with a mineral surface. The starting point is an atomic description of the clay interlayer using molecular simulations. These provide a complete description of the ionic dynamics on short time and length scales. Using the results of these simulations, we then build a robust mesoscopic (Fokker–Planck) description. In turn, this mesoscopic description is used to determine the mobility of the ions in the interlayer. These results can then be cast into a diffusion–reaction scheme, introducing in particular the fraction of mobile ions, or equivalently the distribution coefficient K d . This coefficient is of great importance in characterizing electrokinetic phenomena in porous materials.},

	abstract = {Relative free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations are combined with available experimental binding free energies to predict unknown binding affinities of acyclic Cucurbituril complexes in the blind SAMPL3 competition. The predictions yield root mean square errors between 2.6 and 3.2 kcal/mol for seven host-guest systems. Those deviations are comparable to results for solvation free energies of small organic molecules. However, the standard deviations found in our simulations range from 0.4 to 2.4 kcal/mol, which indicates the need for better sampling. Three different approaches are compared. Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method and thermodynamic integration based on the trapezoidal rule with 12 λ-points exhibit a root mean square error of 2.6 kcal/mol, while thermodynamic integration with Simpson's rule and 11 λ-points leads to a root mean square error of 3.2 kcal/mol. In terms of absolute median errors, Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method performs better than thermodynamic integration with the trapezoidal rule (1.7 vs. 2.9 kcal/mol). Simulations of the deprotonated forms of the guest molecules exhibit a poorer correspondence to experimental results with a root mean square error of 5.2 kcal/mol. In addition, a decrease of the buffer concentration by approximately 20 mM in the simulations raises the root mean square error to 3.8 kcal/mol.},

	abstract = {The complex behavior of liquid water, along with its anomalies and their crucial role in the existence of life, continue to attract the attention of researchers. The anomalous behavior of water is more pronounced at subfreezing temperatures and numerous theoretical and experimental studies are directed towards developing a coherent thermodynamic and dynamic framework for understanding supercooled water. The existence of a liquid–liquid critical point in the deep supercooled region has been related to the anomalous behavior of water. However, the experimental study of supercooled water at very low temperatures is hampered by the homogeneous nucleation of the crystal. Recently, water confined in nanoscopic structures or in solutions has attracted interest because nucleation can be delayed. These systems have a tremendous relevance also for current biological advances; e.g., supercooled water is often confined in cell membranes and acts as a solvent for biological molecules. In particular, considerable attention has been recently devoted to understanding hydrophobic interactions or the behavior of water in the presence of apolar interfaces due to their fundamental role in self-assembly of micelles, membrane formation and protein folding. This article reviews and compares two very recent computational works aimed at elucidating the changes in the thermodynamic behavior in the supercooled region and the liquid–liquid critical point phenomenon for water in contact with hydrophobic environments. The results are also compared to previous reports for water in hydrophobic environments.},

Our calculations are performed using both a T-matrix approximation and a tight-binding exact diagonalization technique. They allow us to numerically obtain the local density of states as a function of energy and position as well as an analytical form of the Friedel oscillations in the continuum limit. The two techniques yield results that are in excellent agreement, confirming the accuracy of such methods to approach this problem.},

These major corrosion problems are summarized and their causes are described. Two significant problems are emphasized: (1) intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) that has affected regions adjacent to welds in austenitic stainless steel in boiling water reactors (BWRs); (2) IGSCC that has been sustained by Alloy 600 used both as steam generator tubes and as reactor coolant system penetrations in pressurized water reactors (PWRs). This review discusses the technical bases that were used at the time of the selection of these materials together with the subsequent failures that occurred in service and the problems with the original technical bases. Institutional factors that contributed to the selection of materials that experienced severe corrosion problems are discussed. Implications from these problems for future applications are discussed where failures have major impacts on economics, safety or operation.},

	abstract = {Meta-benzoquinodimethane (MBQDM) or m-xylylene provides a model for larger organic diradicals, the triplet–singlet gap being the key property. In the present work this energy difference has been the object of a systematic study by means of several density functional theory-based methods including B3LYP, M06, M06-2X, HSE and LC-ωPBE potentials and a variety of wave function-based methods such as complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF), Multireference second-order Møller–Plesset (MRMP), difference dedicated configuration interaction (DDCI), and Multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). In each case various basis sets of increasing quality have been explored, and the effect of the molecular geometry is also analyzed. The use of the triplet and broken symmetry (BS) solutions for the corresponding optimized geometries obtained from B3LYP and especially M06-2X functionals provide the value of the adiabatic triplet–singlet gap closer to experiment when compared to the reported value of Wenthold, Kim, and Lineberger, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 1354) and also for the electron affinity. The agreement further improves using the full π-valence CASSCF(8,8) optimized geometry as an attempt to correct for the spin contamination effects on the geometry of the BS state. The CASSCF, MRMP, and MRCI, even with the full π valence CAS(8,8) as reference and relatively large basis set, systematically overestimate the experimental value indicating either that an accurate description must go beyond this level of theory, including σ electrons and higher order polarization functions, or perhaps that the measured value is affected by the experimental conditions.},

The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparisons with analytic solutions for the case of a single charge in a dielectric sphere (Tanford-Kirkwood theory), which serves as a model for a macromolecule. We find that the solutions are generally accurate to within 5\%. Larger errors occur close to the charge and the dielectric boundary, but the maximum error found at ion-bonding distance (3 Å) from a charge close to the boundary (1 Å deep) is only ∼15\%. Several algorithmic improvements, described here, contribute to the accuracy of the method. The programs involved compose a coherent software package, called Del Phi, which goes from a Brookhaven Protein Data Bank format file to calculated electrostatic fields.},

	abstract = {Dense hard-particle packings are intimately related to the structure of low-temperature phases of matter and are useful models of heterogeneous materials and granular media. Most studies of the densest packings in three dimensions have considered spherical shapes, and it is only more recently that nonspherical shapes (e.g., ellipsoids) have been investigated. Superballs (whose shapes are defined by {\textbar}x1{\textbar}2p+{\textbar}x2{\textbar}2p+{\textbar}x3{\textbar}2p≤1) provide a versatile family of convex particles (p≥0.5) with both cubic-like and octahedral-like shapes as well as concave particles (0{\textless}p{\textless}0.5) with octahedral-like shapes. In this paper, we provide analytical constructions for the densest known superball packings for all convex and concave cases. The candidate maximally dense packings are certain families of Bravais lattice packings (in which each particle has 12 contacting neighbors) possessing the global symmetries that are consistent with certain symmetries of a superball. We also provide strong evidence that our packings for convex superballs (p≥0.5) are most likely the optimal ones. The maximal packing density as a function of p is nonanalytic at the sphere point (p=1) and increases dramatically as p moves away from unity. Two more nontrivial nonanalytic behaviors occur at pc∗=1.150 9… and po∗=ln 3/ln 4=0.792 4… for “cubic” and “octahedral” superballs, respectively, where different Bravais lattice packings possess the same densities. The packing characteristics determined by the broken rotational symmetry of superballs are similar to but richer than their two-dimensional “superdisk” counterparts [ Y. Jiao et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 245504 (2008)] and are distinctly different from that of ellipsoid packings. Our candidate optimal superball packings provide a starting point to quantify the equilibrium phase behavior of superball systems, which should deepen our understanding of the statistical thermodynamics of nonspherical-particle systems.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jnucmat.2003.08.023},
	abstract = {We describe the highly efficient master curves-shifts (MC-[Delta]T) method to measure and apply cleavage fracture toughness, KJc(T), data and show that it is applicable to 9Cr martensitic steels. A reference temperature, T0, indexes the invariant MC shape on an absolute temperature scale. Then, T0 shifts ([Delta]T) are used to account for various effects of size and geometry, loading rate and irradiation embrittlement ([Delta]Ti). The paper outlines a multiscale model, relating atomic to structural scale fracture processes, that underpins the MC-[Delta]T method. At the atomic scale, we propose that the intrinsic microarrest toughness, K[mu](T), of the body-centered cubic ferrite lattice dictates an invariant shape of the macroscopic KJc(T) curve. KJc(T) can be modeled in terms of the true stress-strain ([sigma]-[var epsilon]) constitutive law, [sigma] (T,[epsilon]), combined with a temperature-dependent critical local stress, [sigma]*(T) and stressed volume, V*. The local fracture properties, [sigma]*(T)-V*, are governed by coarse-scale brittle trigger particles and K[mu](T). Irradiation (and high strain rate) induced increases in the yield stress, [Delta][sigma]y, lead to [Delta]Ti, with typical [Delta]Ti/[Delta][sigma]y[approximate]0.6±0.15 °C/MPa. However, [Delta]Ti associated with decreases in [sigma]* and V* can result from a number of potential non-hardening embrittlement (NHE) mechanisms, including a large amount of He on grain boundaries. Estimates based on available data suggest that this occurs at {\textgreater}500-700 appm bulk He. Hardening and NHE are synergistic, and can lead to very large [Delta]Ti. NHE is signaled by large ({\textgreater}1 °C/MPa), or even negative, values of [Delta]Ti/[Delta][sigma]y (for [Delta][sigma]y{\textless}0), and is often coupled with increasing amounts of intergranular fracture. The measured and effective fracture toughness pertinent to structures almost always depends on the size and geometry of the cracked body, and is typically significantly greater than KJc. Size and geometry effects arise from both weakest link statistics, related to the volume under high stress near a crack tip, and constraint loss associated with large amounts of deformation in small specimens and shallow surface cracks. We describe micromechanical models that can be used to adjust the toughness measured using small specimens to both the intrinsic material KJc and the effective toughness pertinent to a structure. Finally, using a simple example, we illustrate the profound implications of size-geometry effects on the fracture of fusion structures. This assessment is based on a metric of strength and ductility, specified as the ratios of the critical load and displacement at fracture to the corresponding yield load and displacement, Pc/Py and [Delta]c/[Delta]y, respectively. Even in cases where the material experiences very brittle elastic fracture in standard tests, or in heavy sections, with Pc/Py{\textless}1, the extrinsic factors pertinent to fusion structures (small shallow cracks in thin sections, etc.) lead to Pc/Py{\textgreater}1 and [Delta]c/[Delta]y{\textgreater}{\textgreater}1. Indeed, in some circumstances, the benefits of irradiation due to increases in Pc may more than offset the liabilities of the decreases in [Delta]c.},

We find that χ3(ω,T) indeed displays several nontrivial features. It is peaked as a function of the frequency ω and obeys scaling as a function of ωτ(T), with τ(T) the relaxation time of the liquid. The height of the peak, proportional to the number of dynamically correlated molecules Ncorr(T), increases as the system becomes glassy, and χ3 decays as a power law of ω over several decades beyond the peak. These findings confirm the collective nature of the glassy dynamics and provide the first direct estimate of the T dependence of Ncorr.},

We consider aqueous NaCl solutions at ambient conditions, using the standard SPC/E force field for water and the Joung-Cheatham force field for the electrolyte. We calculate the water chemical potential using the osmotic ensemble Monte Carlo algorithm by varying the number of water molecules at a constant amount of solute. We demonstrate numerical consistency of these results in terms of the Gibbs-Duhem equation in conjunction with our previous calculations of the electrolyte chemical potential. We present the chemical potential vs molality curves for both solvent and solute in the form of appropriately chosen analytical equations fitted to the simulation data. As a byproduct, in the context of the force fields considered, we also obtain values for the Henry convention standard molar chemical potential for aqueous NaCl using molality as the concentration variable and for the chemical potential of pure SPC/E water. These values are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.},

We also consider the more complicated cases with ordered surface phases, nonpseudomorphic overlayers, second layer segregation, and multilayers. The discussion is based on density-functional calculations using the coherent-potential approximation and on effective-medium theory. We give self-consistent density-functional results for the segregation energy and surface mixing energy for all combinations of the transition and noble metals.

	abstract = {In this study, we present conformational energies for a molecular mechanical model (Parm99) developed for organic and biological molecules using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach to derive the partial charges. This approach uses the simple “generic” force field model (Parm94), and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a physical justification. The results are quite encouraging, not only for the 34-molecule set that has been studied by both the highest level ab initiomodel (GVB/LMP2) and experiment, but also for the 55-molecule set for which high-quality experimental data are available. Considering the 55 molecules studied by all the force field models for which there are experimental data, the average absolute errors (AAEs) are 0.28 (this model), 0.52 (MM3), 0.57 (CHARMm [MSI]), and 0.43 kcal/mol (MMFF). For the 34-molecule set, the AAEs of this model versus experiment and ab initio are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, respectively. This is a lower error than found with MM3 and CHARMm, and is comparable to that found with MMFF (0.31 and 0.22 kcal/mol). We also present two examples of how well the torsional parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set. The absolute errors of molecules in the test set are only slightly larger than in the training set (differences of {\textless}0.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be concluded that a simple “generic” force field with a limited number of specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermolecular interactions, although all comparison molecules were selected from our 82-compound training set. We also show how this effective two-body model can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field (NAFF), both with and without lone pairs. Without changing the torsional parameters, the use of more accurate charges and polarization leads to an increase in average absolute error compared with experiment, but adjustment of the parameters restores the level of agreement found with the additive model. After reoptimizing the Ψ, Φ torsional parameters in peptides using alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11 conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the Cornell et al. ( J Am Chem Soc 1995, 117, 5179–5197) force field. The average absolute error of this model for high-level ab initio calculation is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model. For nucleosides, the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et al. model. To optimize force field parameters, we developed a program called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a systematic manner and finally obtain the best torsional potentials. Besides the organic molecules in our test set, parmscan was also successful in optimizing the Ψ, Φ torsional parameters in peptides to significantly improve agreement between molecular mechanical and high-level ab initio energies. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {We develop a general method for calculating conduction-diffusion transport properties of strong electrolyte mixtures, including specific conductivities, steady-state electrophoretic mobilities, and self-diffusion coefficients. The ions are described as charged Brownian spheres, and the solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are also accounted for in the non-instantaneous ion atmosphere relaxation effect. A linear response expression relating long-time partial mobilities to associated dynamic structure factors is employed in our derivation of a general mode coupling theory (MCT) method for the conduction-diffusion properties. A simplified solution scheme for the MCT method is discussed. Analytic results are obtained for transport coefficients of pointlike ions which, for very low ion concentrations, reduce to the Deby-Falkenhagen-Onsager-Fuoss limiting law expressions. As an application, an unusual non-monotonic concentration dependence of the polyion electrophoretic mobility in a mixture of two binary electrolytes is discussed. In addition, leading-order extensions of the limiting law results are derived with HIs included. The present method complements a related MCT method by the authors for the electrolyte viscosity and shear relaxation function [C. Contreras-Aburto and G. Nägele, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 24, 464108 (2012)], so that a unifying scheme for conduction-diffusion and viscoelastic properties is obtained. We present here the general framework of the method, illustrating its versatility for conditions where fully analytic results are obtainable. Numerical results for conduction-diffusion properties and the viscosity of concentrated electrolytes are presented in Paper II [C. Contreras Aburto and G. Nägele, J. Chem.

By calculating the time evolution of the various coherences of spin 1 nuclei under the irradiation pulse implied in these spin-locking relaxation measurements, we illustrate how the paramagnetic coupling largely extends the dynamical range usually investigated by such relaxation measurements. We exploit that property to compare the water mobility predicted, at a reduced time scale, by molecular dynamics simulations with the average residence time of the water molecules inside the clay interlayer.},

Most commercial Li-ion batteries use positive electrodes based on lithium cobalt oxides. Despite showing a lower voltage than cobalt-based systems (3.45 V versus 4 V) and a lower energy density, LiFePO(4) has emerged as a promising contender owing to the cost sensitivity of higher-volume markets. LiFePO(4) also shows intrinsically low ionic and electronic transport, necessitating nanosizing and/or carbon coating. Clearly, there is a need for inexpensive materials with higher energy densities. Although this could in principle be achieved by introducing fluorine and by replacing phosphate groups with more electron-withdrawing sulphate groups, this avenue has remained unexplored. Herein, we synthesize and show promising electrode performance for LiFeSO(4)F. This material shows a slightly higher voltage (3.6 V versus Li) than LiFePO(4) and suppresses the need for nanosizing or carbon coating while sharing the same cost advantage. This work not only provides a positive-electrode contender to rival LiFePO(4), but also suggests that broad classes of fluoro-oxyanion materials could be discovered.},

	abstract = {We applied over a decade ago the two-body coupled-rotator slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) approach to NMR relaxation in proteins. One rotator is the globally moving protein and the other rotator is the locally moving probe (spin-bearing moiety, typically the 15N−1H bond). So far we applied SRLS to 15N−H relaxation from seven different proteins within the scope of the commonly used data-fitting paradigm. Here, we solve the SRLS Smoluchowski equation using typical best-fit parameters as input, to obtain the corresponding generic time correlation functions (TCFs). The following new information is obtained. For actual rhombic local ordering and main ordering axis pointing along Ci−1α−Ciα, the measurable TCF is dominated by the (K,K′) = (−2,2), (2,2), and (0,2) components (K is the order of the rank 2 local ordering tensor), determined largely by the local motion. Global diffusion axiality affects the analysis significantly when the ratio between the parallel and perpendicular components exceeds approximately 1.5. Local diffusion axiality has a large and intricate effect on the analysis. Mode-coupling becomes important when the ratio between the global and local motional rates falls below 0.01. The traditional method of analysis − model-free (MF) − represents a simple limit of SRLS. The conditions under which the MF and SRLS TCFs are the same are specified. The validity ranges of wobble-in-a-cone and rotation on the surface of a cone as local motions are determined. The evolution of the intricate Smoluchowski operator from the simple diffusion operator for a sphere reorienting in isotropic medium is delineated. This highlights the fact that SRLS is an extension of the established stochastic theories for treating restricted motions. This study lays the groundwork for TCF-based comparison between mesoscopic SRLS and atomistic molecular dynamics.},

A stirred-flow method was employed to perform experiments. Apparent adsorption and desorption rate coefficients were determined by a one-site second-order kinetic model. Both adsorption and desorption were characterized by a biphasic pattern, a fast step followed by a slow step. After 2 min, the Hg(II) adsorbed for an 8 mg L-1 influent accounted for 4?38\% of the total Hg(II) adsorbed within 5 h. Of the Hg(II) released within 8 h, 62?81\% was desorbed during the first 100 min. Both adsorption and desorption rate coefficients were inversely correlated with the soil organic C content. Not all adsorbed Hg(II) was readily released. The greater the soil organic C content, the higher the fraction of Hg(II) that was resistant to desorption. The diffusion of Hg(II) through intraparticle micropores of soil organic matter may be the principal factor responsible for the observed irreversibility. In addition, the binding of Hg(II) to high affinity sites on soil organic matter, such as the S-containing (-S) groups, may also be important to Hg(II) persistence in soils.},

	abstract = {We review recent theoretical results obtained for the wetting and drying behavior of ionic solutions near a charged solid substrate. Three levels of modeling ionic solutions are considered: the primitive model, where the solvent is replaced by a dielectric continuum, the ‘semi-primitive’ model where the solvent is represented by hard spheres with a Yukawa attraction and a dielectric permittivity is introduced, which depends on the local solvent density, and the ‘civilized’ model, where the solvent molecules are dipolar hard spheres with a Yukawa attraction. Calculations on the primitive model are based on a square gradient functional for the solvent, combined with a Poisson–Boltzmann description of the ions; the discrete solvent models are treated within a multi-component density functional theory, combining Rosenfeld's fundamental measure description of excluded volume effects with the mean-field approximation for the Yukawa and electrostatic interactions. Qualitative agreement is found between the predictions of the three models, while those of the two discrete solvent models agree quantitatively. The relative size of anions and cations is shown to have a crucial influence on interfacial properties, as observed experimentally. A novel drying scenario is predicted near a charged wall. New results are reported for the variation of the surface tension γ with ion concentration c. Contrary to the observed behavior of aqueous ionic solutions, the liquid/vapor surface tension is found to systematically decrease with c, presumably because our solvent models are insufficient to describe water, due to the neglect of strong hydrogen bonding. The solid/liquid surface tension is, in contrast, shown to be a non-monotonic function of c and to possess a minimum.},

The site–site correlation functions are obtained and compared to available computer simulation results. Further, the variation of liquid state structure with the model site charge is examined. The analysis of these results has demonstrated that the integral equation approach provides a correct qualitative description of the liquid structure, although the amplitudes of most structural features are somewhat less accurate that their positions. Comparison to our earlier results for simpler models suggests that the nature of the quantitative deficiencies of the approach is predictable. The charging study has shown that the development of waterlike structure with increasing site charge follows a qualitatively different pattern for oxygen–oxygen pairs, compared to those involving hydrogen. This is attributed to interference between the amplitudes characteristic of liquid water and of simple liquids. These results suggest that this is the origin of a relatively flat 0–0 correlation function for several models studied in the past, and, further, that such results should not be properly characterized as ’’unstructured.’’},

The liposomes, acting as signal enhancer elements, enabled the number of binding events as well as the residence time for high affinity binders (Kd {\textless} 1 nM, koff {\textless} 0.01 s−1) to be collected under equilibrium conditions at low pM concentrations. The mismatch discrimination obtained from the residence time data was shown to be concentration and temperature independent in intervals of 1–100 pM and 23–46°C, respectively.

For this purpose, we have developed a classical model for the water–substrate interactions that solely depends on the coordinates of the particles and does not require the definition of geometrically smooth boundary surfaces or image planes. The model includes both an electrostatic induction for the metal atoms (determined by means of an extended Lagrangian technique) and a site‐specific treatment of the water–metal chemisorption. As a validation of the model we have investigated the structure of water monolayers on metal substrates of various topology [the (111), (110), and (100) crystallographic faces] and composition (Pt, Ag, Cu, and Ni), and compared the results to experiments. The modeling of the electrostatic induction is compatible with a finite external potential imposed on the metal. This feature is used to investigate the structural rearrangements of the water bilayer between the pair of scanning tunneling microscopeelectrodes in response to an applied external voltage difference. We find significant asymmetry in the dependence on the sign of the applied voltage. Another result of the calculation is an estimate of the perturbation to the work function caused by the wetting film. For the conditions typical for operation of a scanning tunneling microscope probe, the change in the work function is found to be comparable to the applied voltage (a few hundred millivolts).},

The structures of the dimethyl sulfoxide solvated alkali metal ions in solution have been determined to support the studies in aqueous solution. The results of the LAXS and DDIR measurements show that the sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions all are weakly hydrated with only a single shell of water molecules. The smaller lithium ion is more strongly hydrated, most probably with a second hydration shell present. The influence of the rubidium and cesium ions on the water structure was found to be very weak, and it was not possible to quantify this effect in a reliable way due to insufficient separation of the O?D stretching bands of partially deuterated water bound to these metal ions and the O?D stretching bands of the bulk water. Aqueous solutions of sodium, potassium and cesium iodide and cesium and lithium hydroxide have been studied by LAXS and M?O bond distances have been determined fairly accurately except for lithium. However, the number of water molecules binding to the alkali metal ions is very difficult to determine from the LAXS measurements as the number of distances and the temperature factor are strongly correlated. A thorough analysis of M?O bond distances in solid alkali metal compounds with ligands binding through oxygen has been made from available structure databases. There is relatively strong correlation between M?O bond distances and coordination numbers also for the alkali metal ions even though the M?O interactions are weak and the number of complexes of potassium, rubidium and cesium with well-defined coordination geometry is very small. The mean M?O bond distance in the hydrated sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution have been determined to be 2.43(2), 2.81(1), 2.98(1) and 3.07(1) Å, which corresponds to six-, seven-, eight- and eight-coordination. These coordination numbers are supported by the linear relationship of the hydration enthalpies and the M?O bond distances. This correlation indicates that the hydrated lithium ion is four-coordinate in aqueous solution. New ionic radii are proposed for four- and six-coordinate lithium(I), 0.60 and 0.79 Å, respectively, as well as for five- and six-coordinate sodium(I), 1.02 and 1.07 Å, respectively. The ionic radii for six- and seven-coordinate K+, 1.38 and 1.46 Å, respectively, and eight-coordinate Rb+ and Cs+, 1.64 and 1.73 Å, respectively, are confirmed from previous studies. The M?O bond distances in dimethyl sulfoxide solvated sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in solution are very similar to those observed in aqueous solution.},

Here we report direct experimental evidence for a genuine (isocompositional) LLT without macroscopic phase separation in an aqueous solution of glycerol. We show that liquid I transforms into liquid II by way of two types of kinetics: nucleation and growth, and spinodal decomposition. Although liquid II is metastable against crystallization, we could access both its static and dynamical properties experimentally. We find that liquids I and II differ in density, refractive index, structure, hydrogen bonding state, glass transition temperature and fragility, and that the transition between the two liquids is mainly driven by the local structuring of water rather than of glycerol, suggesting a link to a plausible LLT in pure water.},

In order to provide a basis for comparison, as well as to see if a simpler scheme will suffice, we also calculate the spectrum of the same alloy using the average t-matrix approximation introduced by Beeby. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the average t-matrix approximation is not adequate for the description of an actual transition-metal alloy, while the coherent-potential picture will provide a more reasonable facsimile of the density of states in such an alloy.},

	abstract = {A new method based upon the Zwanzig–Mori projection operator technique has been introduced to treat the spin–lattice relaxation problem of coupled nuclear spin systems in liquids, with emphasis on high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The important quantities required for the use of the method are a set of orthogonal operators which can readily be constructed and given physical meaning in the eigenstate representation for any particular spin system. Some of the expectation values of these orthogonal operators may be related to the measurable quantity in high resolution NMR experiments. The time rate of change of each observable may then be formulated in terms of the trace of various operator functions, allowing the calculation to be carried out in any representation. The computational advantage of using simple spin‐product functions is obvious. The prescription for constructing irreducible orthogonal tensor operators is given, and a variety of such tensor operators are explicitly given for several common spin systems. In the present method each orthogonal operator has a definite symmetry property under spin inversion which can be used to separate the coupled equations into a symmetric and an antisymmetric set. The problem of multiexponential decay in the time evaluation of the longitudinal magnetization, owing to effects of interferences between pairwise dipolar interactions, becomes clear in the present formalism. The present paper is a generalization of earlier work on the relaxation behavior of multiplet spectral structure in high resolution NMR.},

Une forme approchée de la fonctionnelle d'excès pour l'eau est proposée. Cette fonctionnelle nécessite l'utilisation de fonctions de corrélation du solvant pur. Celles-ci peuvent être calculées par simulations numériques, dynamique moléculaire ou Monte Carlo ou obtenues expérimentalement. La minimisation de cette fonctionnelle donne accès à l'énergie libre de solvatation ainsi qu'à la densité d'équilibre du solvant. Différentes corrections de cette fonctionnelle approchée sont proposées. Une correction permet de renforcer l'ordre tétraédrique du solvant eau autour des solutés chargés, une autre permet de reproduire le comportement hydrophobe à longue distance de solutés apolaires. Pour réaliser la minimisation numérique de la fonctionnelle, la théorie a été implémentée sur une double grille tridimensionnelle pour les coordonnées angulaires et spatiales, dans un code de minimisation fonctionnelle écrit en Fortran moderne, mdft. Ce programme a été utilisé pour étudier la solvatation en milieu aqueux de petits solutés atomiques neutres et chargés et de petites molécules polaires et apolaires ainsi que de solutés plus complexes, une argile hydrophobe et une petite protéine. Dans chacun des cas la théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité classique permet d'obtenir des résultats similaires à ceux théoriquement exacts obtenus par dynamique moléculaire, avec des temps de calculs inférieurs d'au moins trois ordres de grandeurs.},

This conclusion from ionic exchange enthalpies supports the one of a recent study of the ionic exchange free energy by Teppen and Miller [Teppen B. J. and Miller D. M. (2006) Hydration energy determines isovalent cation exchange selectivity by clay minerals. Soil Sci. Soc. Am.

	abstract = {A unified treatment of polarization relaxation, dielectric dispersion and solvation dynamics in a dense, dipolar liquid is presented. It is shown that the information of solvent polarization relaxation that is obtained by macroscopic dielectric dispersion experiments is not sufficient to understand dynamics of solvation of a newly created ion or dipole. In solvation, a significant contribution comes from intermediate wave vector processes which depend critically on the short range (nearest‐neighbor) spatial and orientational order that are present in a dense, dipolar liquid. An analytic expression is obtained for the time dependent solvation energy that depends, in addition to the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of the liquid, on the ratio of solute–solvent molecular sizes and on the microscopic structure of the polar liquid. Mean spherical approximation (MSA) theory is used to obtain numerical results for polarization relaxation, for wave vector and frequency dependent dielectric function and for time dependent solvation energy. We find that in the absence of translational contribution, the solvation of an ion is, in general, nonexponential. In this case, the short time decay is dominated by the longitudinal relaxation time but the long time decay is dominated by much slower large wave vector processes involving nearest‐neighbor molecules. The presence of a significant translational contribution drastically alters the decay behavior. Now, the long‐time behavior is given by the longitudinal relaxation time constant and the short time dynamics is controlled by the large wave vector processes. Thus, although the continuum model itself is conceptually wrong, a continuum model like result is recovered in the presence of a sizeable translational contribution. The continuum model result is also recovered in the limit of large solute to solvent size ratio. In the opposite limit of small solute size, the decay is markedly nonexponential (if the translational contribution is not very large) and a complete breakdown of the continuum model takes place. The significance of these results is discussed.},

	abstract = {Methods to compute free energy differences between different states of a molecular system are reviewed with the aim of identifying their basic ingredients and their utility when applied in practice to biomolecular systems. A free energy calculation is comprised of three basic components: (i) a suitable model or Hamiltonian, (ii) a sampling protocol with which one can generate a representative ensemble of molecular configurations, and (iii) an estimator of the free energy difference itself. Alternative sampling protocols can be distinguished according to whether one or more states are to be sampled. In cases where only a single state is considered, six alternative techniques could be distinguished: (i) changing the dynamics, (ii) deforming the energy surface, (iii) extending the dimensionality, (iv) perturbing the forces, (v) reducing the number of degrees of freedom, and (vi) multi-copy approaches. In cases where multiple states are to be sampled, the three primary techniques are staging, importance sampling, and adiabatic decoupling. Estimators of the free energy can be classified as global methods that either count the number of times a given state is sampled or use energy differences. Or, they can be classified as local methods that either make use of the force or are based on transition probabilities. Finally, this overview of the available techniques and how they can be best used in a practical context is aimed at helping the reader choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for the biomolecular system, Hamiltonian and free energy difference of interest. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Density functional theory calculations have been used to study the mixing behavior of Fe-Cr alloys. The heats of formation ΔEf of 65 Fe-Cr structures in their magnetic ground states have been determined. A positive ΔEf is found over most of the concentration range. From 0–12 \% Cr a small negative ΔEf down to −8 meV/atom is found. The origin of the negative ΔEf in Fe-rich structures is traced to the solution energy of single Cr atoms. At low concentration, Cr atoms in Fe repel each other, causing ordering. The Cr-Cr interactions are well reproduced even without the self-consistent relaxation of the electron density and the positions of atoms. Multi-ion (or concentration-dependent) interactions are indispensable in order to describe the whole phase diagram. The interesting magnetic situation that arises when ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic metals are mixed in different ratios is discussed with reference to nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor clusters of Cr in Fe. Magnetic frustration leads to a strong dependence of the Cr moment on the number of Cr neighbors. The “normal” chemical-mixing energy and the influence of magnetism are distinguished by comparing magnetic and nonmagnetic calculations for similar systems.},

Using four different density-functional methods, we show that there is a magnetic transition close to the ground-state volume of bcc Fe, which originates from the particular magnetic band structure. The common equation of state functions, used to determine the basic ground-state physical quantities from the calculated total energies, cannot capture the physics of this magnetic transition leading to serious underestimation of the Fe bulk modulus. Ignorance of the magnetic transition found here is reflected by large scatter of the published theoretical bulk moduli of ferromagnetic bcc Fe. Due to the low performance of the exchange-correlation functionals, most of the erroneous results are accidentally in good agreement with the experimental values. The present finding is of fundamental importance, especially taking into account that bcc Fe is frequently used as a test system in assessing the performance of exchange-correlation approximations or total-energy methods.},

	abstract = {Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase Fe protein (Av2) provides a rare opportunity to investigate a [4Fe-4S] cluster at three oxidation levels in the same protein environment. Here, we report the structural and vibrational changes of this cluster upon reduction using a combination of NRVS and EXAFS spectroscopies and DFT calculations. Key to this work is the synergy between these three techniques as each generates highly complementary information and their analytical methodologies are interdependent. Importantly, the spectroscopic samples contained no glassing agents. NRVS and DFT reveal a systematic 10?30 cm?1 decrease in Fe?S stretching frequencies with each added electron. The ?oxidized? [4Fe-4S]2+ state spectrum is consistent with and extends previous resonance Raman spectra. For the ?reduced? [4Fe-4S]1+ state in Fe protein, and for any ?all-ferrous? [4Fe-4S]0 cluster, these NRVS spectra are the first available vibrational data. NRVS simulations also allow estimation of the vibrational disorder for Fe?S and Fe?Fe distances, constraining the EXAFS analysis and allowing structural disorder to be estimated. For oxidized Av2, EXAFS and DFT indicate nearly equal Fe?Fe distances, while addition of one electron decreases the cluster symmetry. However, addition of the second electron to form the all-ferrous state induces significant structural change. EXAFS data recorded to k = 21 Å?1 indicates a 1:1 ratio of Fe?Fe interactions at 2.56 Å and 2.75 Å, a result consistent with DFT. Broken symmetry (BS) DFT rationalizes the interplay between redox state and the Fe?S and Fe?Fe distances as predominantly spin-dependent behavior inherent to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and perturbed by the Av2 protein environment.},

The role of the hydration number of sugars--found higher for trehalose--on the destructuring effect of the water hydrogen bond network is also addressed. The analysis of the water O-H-O bending spectral range [1500,1800] cm(-1) reveals a change of the homogeneity of water molecules influenced by sugars, but the three investigated sugars are found to behave similarly.},

	abstract = {This work describes an improved version of the original OPLS-all atom (OPLS-AA) force field for carbohydrates (Damm et al., J Comp Chem 1997, 18, 1955). The improvement is achieved by applying additional scaling factors for the electrostatic interactions between 1,5- and 1,6-interactions. This new model is tested first for improving the conformational energetics of 1,2-ethanediol, the smallest polyol. With a 1,5-scaling factor of 1.25 the force field calculated relative energies are in excellent agreement with the ab initio-derived data. Applying the new 1,5-scaling makes it also necessary to use a 1,6-scaling factor for the interactions between the C4 and C6 atoms in hexopyranoses. After torsional parameter fitting, this improves the conformational energetics in comparison to the OPLS-AA force field. The set of hexopyranoses included in the torsional parameter derivation consists of the two anomers of D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-galactose, as well as of the methyl-pyranosides of D-glucose, D-mannose. Rotational profiles for the rotation of the exocyclic group and of different hydroxyl groups are also compared for the two force fields and at the ab initio level of theory. The new force field reduces the overly high barriers calculated using the OPLS-AA force field. This leads to better sampling, which was shown to produce more realistic conformational behavior for hexopyranoses in liquid simulation. From 10-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of alpha-D-glucose and alpha-D-galactose the ratios for the three different conformations of the hydroxymethylene group and the average (3)J(H,H) coupling constants are derived and compared to experimental values. The results obtained for OPLS-AA-SEI force field are in good agreement with experiment whereas the properties derived for the OPLS-AA force field suffer from sampling problems. The undertaken investigations show that the newly derived OPLS-AA-SEI force field will allow simulating larger carbohydrates or polysaccharides with improved sampling of the hydroxyl groups.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive metadynamics study of the energetics, stability, conformational changes, and mechanism of dissociation of gas phase carbonic acid, H2CO3, yields significant new insight into these reactions. The equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies, and conformer energies calculated using the density functional theory are in good agreement with the previous theoretical predictions. At 315 K, the cis-cis conformer has a very short life time and transforms easily to the cis-trans conformer through a change in the O=C-O-H dihedral angle. The energy difference between the trans-trans and cis-trans conformers is very small (approximately 1 kcal/mol), but the trans-trans conformer is resistant to dissociation to carbon dioxide and water. The cis-trans conformer has a relatively short path for one of its hydroxyl groups to accept the proton from the other end of the molecule, resulting in a lower activation barrier for dissociation. Comparison of the free and potential energies of dissociation shows that the entropic contribution to the dissociation energy is less than 10\%. The potential energy barrier for dissociation of H2CO3 to CO2 and H2O from the metadynamics calculations is 5-6 kcal/mol lower than in previous 0 K studies, possibly due to a combination of a finite temperature and more efficient sampling of the energy landscape in the metadynamics calculations. Gas phase carbonic acid dissociation is triggered by the dehydroxylation of one of the hydroxyl groups, which reorients as it approaches the proton on the other end of the molecule, thus facilitating a favorable H-O-H angle for the formation of a product H2O molecule. The major atomic reorganization of the other part of the molecule is a gradual straightening of the O=C=O bond. The metadynamics results provide a basis for future simulation of the more challenging carbonic acid-water system.},

	abstract = {A simple but self-consistent microscopic theory for the time dependent solvation energy of both ions and dipoles is presented which includes, for the first time, the details of the self-motion of the probe on its own solvation dynamics. The theory leads to several interesting predictions. The most important of them is that, for dipolar solvation, both the rotational and the translational motions of the dipolar solute probe can significantly accelerate the rate of solvation. In addition, the rotational self-motion of the solute can also give rise to an additional mechanism of nonexponentiality in solvation time correlation functions in otherwise slow liquids. A comparison between the present theoretical predictions and the recent experimental studies of Maroncelli et al. on solvation dynamics of aniline in 1-propanol seems to indicate that the said experiments have missed the initial solvent response up to about 45 ps. After mapping the experimental results on the redefined time scale, the theoretical results can explain the experimental results for solvation of aniline in 1-propanol very well. For ionic solvation, the translational motion is significant for light solutes only. For example, for Li+ in water, translational motion speeds up the solvation by about 20\%. The present theory demonstrates that in dipolar solvation the partial quenching of the self-motion due to the presence of specific solute?solvent interactions (such as H-bonding) may lead to a much slower solvation than that when the self-motion is present. This point has been discussed. In addition, we present the theoretical results for solvation of aniline in propylene carbonate. Here, the solvation is predicted to be complete within 15?20 ps.},

Phys. 1992, 97, 5653) is generalized to treat particles with arbitrary electric multipole moments. Explicit development of the mean-field approximation is given for the case of mobile dipoles and monopoles (ions) surrounding an arbitrary collection of fixed charges embedded in macroions. In particular, a modified Poisson?Boltzmann (PB) equation is derived in which the mobile dipoles provide an effective spatially dependent dielectric constant. This equation implies a self-consistent iteration procedure by which the monopole and dipole densities are simultaneously determined in terms of single scalar (PB) field. Moreover, this equation can be derived from a minimum principle; an annealing strategy for computing the PB field is thereby suggested. In addition, explicit mean-field expressions for thermodynamic free energies are obtained as simple functionals of the PB field. Connection to the well-known Langevin dipole model is made. A numerical application to a system consisting of two parallel plates is presented in order to illustrate the utility of the formulation.},

These range from first-row dimers at equilibrium and stretched geometries to highly multireference systems such as the chromium dimer and lattice models such as periodic two-dimensional 1-band and 3-band Hubbard models. The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of magnitude over the usual Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm while delivering energies in excellent agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate. As a size-extensive method that can treat large active spaces, MPS-LCC opens up the use of multireference quantum chemical techniques in strongly correlated ab initio Hamiltonians, including two- and three-dimensional solids.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in physical and computer sciences enable quantitative predictions of chemical reactions and thermodynamic data from first principles by multiscale modeling. The hierarchical approach integrates different theoretical frameworks ranging from those describing phenomena at the electronic length and time scales to those pertinent to complex biomolecular systems and macroscopic phase transitions, promising broad applications to problems of practical concern. Whereas multiscale modeling has been emerging as a popular computational tool for engineering applications, the connection between calculations at different scales is far from being coherent, and the multiple choices of quantum/classical methods at each scale renders numerous combinations that have been rarely calibrated against extensive experimental data. In this work, we have examined a multiscale procedure for predicting the solvation free energies of a large set of small molecules in liquid water at ambient conditions. Using the experimental data for the hydration free energies as the benchmark, we find that the theoretical results are sensitive to the selection of quantum-mechanical methods for determining atomic charges and solute configurations, the assignment of the force-field parameters in particular the atomic partial charges, and approximations in the statistical-mechanical calculations. Because of significant uncertainties in quantum-mechanical calculations and the semi-empirical nature of force-field models, computational efficiency makes the classical density functional theory a valuable alternative to molecular simulations for future development and application of multiscale modeling methods.},

	abstract = {Corrosion pits on passive metals such as stainless steels are often initiation sites for stress corrosion cracking (SCC). In this work the effect of mechanical stress on the onset of pitting corrosion was investigated, using microcapillaries as electrochemical cells. Pit initiation at MnS inclusions on 304 SS in 1 M NaCl was studied with and without applied mechanical stress. Polarization curves of areas without inclusions showed no pitting at potentials below that of oxidation evolution; stress had no effect on the corrosion behavior. Areas containing four to five small, round inclusions showed stable pitting dr about 400 mV (SCE); applied stress shifted the pitting potential to values that were 150 mV more negative. Areas containing a single large, shallow MnS inclusion showed multiple current transients during dissolution of the inclusion without stress, but the metastable events did not initiate stable pitting. The dissolution of shallow MnS inclusion did not form a deep microcrevice between the MnS and stainless steel matrix. However, under applied stress, cracks were formed within the shallow MnS inclusion. Scanning electron microscopy investigations showed that active pitting started at the bottom of the formed cracks. Due to mechanical stress microcrevices are formed at or within the inclusions, where the concentrations of aggressive species such as chloride or hydrogen ions reaches a critical value for stable pit propagation. Therefore mechanical stress accelerates the onset of pitting and in this way the formation of potential starting sites for stress corrosion cracking. The chemistry inside a microcrevice was simulated using a 1-D finite difference model. Simulations indicated that in a 3 mum deep microcrevice the combination of pH 2 and a chloride concentration of 6 M lead to stable pitting.},

Examples are given on high surface area porous materials including calibrated porous silica glasses, granular packings, plaster pastes, cement-based materials and natural porous materials, such as sandstone and carbonate rocks. Here, we outline our recent NMR relaxation work for these very different porous materials. For instance, low field NMR relaxation of water in calibrated granular packings leads to striking different pore-size dependencies of the relaxation times T1 and T2 when changing the amount of surface paramagnetic impurities. This allows separation of the diffusion and surface limited regimes of relaxation in these macroporous media. The magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin–lattice relaxation rate 1/T1(ω0) is also a rich source of dynamical information for characterizing the molecular dynamics of liquids in porous media. This allows a continuous characterization of the evolving microstructure of various cementitious materials. Our recent applications of two-dimensional (2D) T1–T2 and T2-z-store-T2 correlation experiments have evidenced the water exchange in connected micropores of cement pastes. The direct probing of water adsorption time on a solid surface gives access to an original characterization of the surface nano-wettability of porous plaster pastes. We show that such a parameter depends directly on the physical chemistry of the pore surfaces. Lastly, we outline our recent measurements of wettability in oil/brine/reservoir carbonate rocks.},

In particular, when the phase diagram exhibits a miscibility gap, one can wonder to what extent surface segregation could be viewed as the first step towards bulk phase separation. We show, in the particular case of very dilute Cu(Ag) alloys, that the actual situation is even more complex. More precisely, using simultaneously an energetic model based on the electronic structure (tight-binding Ising model) and a mean-field approximation formulated as an area-preserving map, we found evidence of incomplete wetting, i.e., a finite succession of layering transitions from almost pure Cu to almost pure Ag planes when the bulk Ag concentration approaches the solubility limit. This theoretical result compares satisfactorily with the experimental surface segregation isotherms derived from kinetics studies using Auger-electron spectroscopy, which indeed exhibit, at least, the first (surface) layering transition. Moreover, the experimentally observed hysteresis between the segregation and dissolution isotherms can be interpreted by taking into account the dependence of the size effect with respect to the surface concentration.},

	abstract = {The structural properties resulting from the reciprocal influence between water and three well-known homologous disaccharides, namely, trehalose, maltose, and sucrose, in aqueous solutions have been investigated in the 4-66 wt \% concentration range by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations. Hydration numbers clearly show that trehalose binds to a larger number of water molecules than do maltose or sucrose, thus affecting the water structure to a deeper extent. Two-dimensional radial distribution functions of trehalose solutions definitely reveal that water is preferentially localized at the hydration sites found in the trehalose dihydrate crystal, this tendency being enhanced when increasing trehalose concentration. Over a rather wide concentration range (4-49 wt \%), the fluctuations of the radius of gyration and of the glycosidic dihedral angles of trehalose indicate a higher flexibility with respect to maltose and sucrose. At sugar concentrations between 33 and 66 wt \%, the mean sugar cluster size and the number of sugar-sugar hydrogen bonds formed within sugar clusters reveal that trehalose is able to form larger clusters than sucrose but smaller than maltose. These features suggest that trehalose-water mixtures would be more homogeneous than the two others, thus reducing both desiccation stresses and ice formation.},

	abstract = {A variety of sugars are known to enhance the stability of biomaterials. Trehalose, a nonreducing disaccharide composed of two alpha, alpha(1 --{\textgreater} 1)-linked D-glucopyranose units, appears to be one of the most effective protectants. Both in vivo and in vitro, trehalose protects biostructures such as proteins and membranes from damage due to dehydration, heat, or cold. However, despite the significant amount of experimental data on this disaccharide, no clear picture of the molecular mechanism responsible for its stabilizing properties has emerged yet. Three major hypotheses (water-trehalose hydrogen-bond replacement, coating by a trapped water layer, and mechanical inhibition of the conformational fluctuations) have been proposed to explain the stabilizing effect of trehalose on proteins. To investigate the nature of protein-trehalose-water interactions in solution at the molecular level, two molecular dynamics simulations of the protein lysozyme in solution at room temperature have been carried out, one in the presence (about 0.5 M) and one in the absence of trehalose. The results show that the trehalose molecules cluster and move toward the protein, but neither completely expel water from the protein surface nor form hydrogen bonds with the protein. Furthermore, the coating by trehalose does not significantly reduce the conformational fluctuations of the protein compared to the trehalose-free system. Based on these observations, a model is proposed for the interaction of trehalose molecules with a protein in moderately concentrated solutions, at room temperature and on the nanosecond timescale.},

While all observations concur with a slowdown of water dynamics relative to the bulk, the magnitude and molecular origin of this retardation remain unclear. Via numerical simulations and theoretical modeling, we establish a molecular description of protein hydration dynamics and identify the key protein features that govern it. Through detailed microscopic mapping of the water reorientation and hydrogen-bond (HB) dynamics around lysozyme, we first determine that 80\% of the hydration layer waters experience a moderate slowdown factor of ?2?3, while the slower residual population is distributed along a power-law tail, in quantitative agreement with recent NMR results. We then establish that the water reorientation mechanism at the protein interface is dominated by large angular jumps similar to the bulk situation. A theoretical extended jump model is shown to provide the first rigorous determination of the two key contributions to the observed slowdown: a topological excluded-volume factor resulting from the local protein geometry, which governs the dynamics of the fastest 80\% of the waters, and a free energetic factor arising from the water?protein HB strength, which is especially important for the remaining waters in confined sites at the protein interface. These simple local factors are shown to provide a nearly quantitative description of the hydration shell dynamics.},

	abstract = {The direct correlation function (DCF) plays a pivotal role in addressing the thermodynamic properties with non-mean-field statistical theories of liquid state. This work provides an accurate yet efficient calculation procedure for evaluating the angular-dependent DCF of bulk SPC/E water. The DCF here represented in a discrete angles basis is computed with two typical steps: the first step involves solving the molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation with the input of total correlation function extracted from simulation; the resultant DCF is then polished in second step at small wavelength for all orientations in order to match correct thermodynamic properties. This function is also discussed in terms of its rotational invariant components. In particular, we show that the component c112(r) that accounts for dipolar symmetry reaches already its long-range asymptotic behavior at a short distance of 4 Å. With the knowledge of DCF, the angular-dependent bridge function of bulk water is thereafter computed and discussed in comparison with referenced hard-sphere bridge functions. We conclude that, even though such hard-sphere bridge functions may be relevant to improve the calculation of Helmholtz free energies in integral equations or density functional theory, they are doomed to fail at a structural level.},

As a result, there is enormous interest in studying its structure, dynamics, and function. Here we report the results of three all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, each at least 1.5 micros, which predict that substantial changes in internal hydration play a functional role in rhodopsin activation. We confirm with (1)H magic angle spinning NMR that the increased hydration is specific to the metarhodopsin-I intermediate. The internal water molecules interact with several conserved residues, suggesting that changes in internal hydration may be important during the activation of other GPCRs. The results serve to illustrate the synergism of long-time-scale molecular dynamics simulations and NMR in enhancing our understanding of GPCR function.},

In this study, we consider six different trehalose concentrations ranging from 0\% to 56\%. We observe that with increasing trehalose concentration the dispersion of solute neopentane takes place. The neopentane-neopentane association constant value decreases with addition of trehalose. Our preferential interaction calculations suggest that with increasing trehalose concentration neopentane interacts preferentially with water over trehalose. Site-site neopentane-trehalose rdfs indicate that trehalose molecules are expelled out from the neopentane surface. Also observed are (i) trehalose induced second shell collapse of water network (ii) decrease in average number of water-water and water-trehalose hydrogen bonds with increasing trehalose concentration. We also find that addition of trehalose decreases the translational motion of all the solution species. The decrease in diffusion coefficient value is more pronounced for trehalose. We, further, observe that the ratio of the diffusion coefficient values of water and trehalose increases with increasing trehalose concentration.},

	abstract = {We describe a general multinuclear (1H, 23Na, 87Rb) NMR approach for direct detection of alkali metal ions bound to G-quadruplex DNA. This study is motivated by our recent discovery that alkali metal ions (Na+, K+, Rb+) tightly bound to G-quadruplex DNA are actually ?NMR visible? in solution (Wong, A.; Ida, R.; Wu, G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005, 337, 363). Here solution and solid-state NMR methods are developed for studying ion binding to the classic G-quadruplex structures formed by three DNA oligomers:? d(TG4T), d(G4T3G4), and d(G4T4G4). The present study yields the following major findings. (1) Alkali metal ions tightly bound to G-quadruplex DNA can be directly observed by NMR in solution. (2) Competitive ion binding to the G-quadruplex channel site can be directly monitored by simultaneous NMR detection of the two competing ions. (3) Na+ ions are found to locate in the diagonal T4 loop region of the G-quadruplex formed by two strands of d(G4T4G4). This is the first time that direct NMR evidence has been found for alkali metal ion binding to the diagonal T4 loop in solution. We propose that the loop Na+ ion is located above the terminal G-quartet, coordinating to four guanine O6 atoms from the terminal G-quartet and one O2 atom from a loop thymine base and one water molecule. This Na+ ion coordination is supported by quantum chemical calculations on 23Na chemical shifts. Variable-temperature 23Na NMR results have revealed that the channel and loop Na+ ions in d(G4T4G4) exhibit very different ion mobilities. The loop Na+ ions have a residence lifetime of 220 ?s at 15 °C, whereas the residence lifetime of Na+ ions residing inside the G-quadruplex channel is 2 orders of magnitude longer. (4) We have found direct 23Na NMR evidence that mixed K+ and Na+ ions occupy the d(G4T4G4) G-quadruplex channel when both Na+ and K+ ions are present in solution. (5) The high spectral resolution observed in this study is unprecedented in solution 23Na NMR studies of biological macromolecules. Our results strongly suggest that multinuclear NMR is a viable technique for studying ion binding to G-quadruplex DNA.},

	abstract = {Water adsorption and dissociation on catalytic metal surfaces play a key role in a variety of industrial processes, and a detailed understanding of this process and how it is effected by the surface structure will assist in developing improved catalysts. Hence, a comparative study of the adsorption and dissociation of water on Ni(111), Ni(110) and Ni(100) surfaces, which is often used as catalyst, has been performed using density functional theory. The results show that the adsorption energies and dissociation rates depend on the surface structure. The adsorption energies for H2O and OH decrease in the order Ni(110) \&gt; Ni(100) \&gt; Ni(111), and for the O and H atoms the adsorption energies decrease in the order Ni(100) \&gt; Ni(111) \&gt; Ni(110). In addition, the splitting of water to OH and H has lower activation energies over less packed Ni(110) and Ni(100) surfaces compared to the highly packed Ni(111) surface. The subsequent splitting of the OH to O and H also has the lowest activation energy on the Ni(110) surface. At 463 K, which is typical for industrial processes that include the water gas shift reaction, the H2O splitting is approximately 6000 and 10 times faster on the Ni(110) surface compared to the Ni(111) and Ni(100) surfaces, respectively, and OH splitting is 200 and 3000 times faster, respectively. The complete water dissociation reaction rate decreases in the order Ni(110) \&gt; Ni(100) \&gt; Ni(111).},

This is an operative definition of cage variables that allows their identification at each time step of molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, quantitative information about the equilibrium properties and the dynamics of cage variables can be extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. This procedure is applied to liquid argon near the triple point, in order to recognize the different processes contributing to the cage diffusion.

The first shell coordination number was found to be ?8 in the HF and ?9 in the B3LYP and BP86 case and several other structural parameters such as angular distribution functions, radial distribution functions, and tilt- and ?-angle distributions allowed to fully characterize the hydration structure of the Cs+ ion. Velocity autocorrelation functions were used to calculate librational and vibrational motions, ion?ligand motions, as well as reorientation times. The strong ?structure breaking? effect of Cs+ can be interpreted on the basis of different dynamical parameters such as accelerated water reorientation, mean ligand residence time, and the number of ligand exchange processes.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive study is presented on the short-time dynamics in suspensions of charged colloidal spheres. The explored parameter space covers the major part of the fluid-state regime, with colloid concentrations extending up to the freezing transition. The particles are assumed to interact directly by a hard-core plus screened Coulomb potential, and indirectly by solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions. By comparison with accurate accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD) simulations of the hydrodynamic function H(q), and the high-frequency viscosity η∞, we investigate the accuracy of two fast and easy-to-implement analytical schemes. The first scheme, referred to as the pairwise additive (PA) scheme, uses exact two-body hydrodynamic mobility tensors. It is in good agreement with the ASD simulations of H(q) and η∞, for smaller volume fractions up to about 10\% and 20\%, respectively. The second scheme is a hybrid method combining the virtues of the δγ scheme by Beenakker and Mazur with those of the PA scheme. It leads to predictions in good agreement with the simulation data, for all considered concentrations, combining thus precision with computational efficiency. The hybrid method is used to test the accuracy of a generalized Stokes-Einstein (GSE) relation proposed by Kholodenko and Douglas, showing its severe violation in low salinity systems. For hard spheres, however, this GSE relation applies decently well.},

	abstract = {A crucial process in biological cells is the translocation of newly synthesized proteins across cell membranes via integral membrane protein pores termed translocons. Recent improved techniques now allow producing artificial membranes with pores of similar dimensions of a few nm as the translocon system. For the translocon system, the protein has to be unfolded, whereas the artificial pores are wide enough so that small proteins can pass through even when folded. To study how proteins permeate through such membrane pores, we used coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations where the proteins were modeled as single beads or bead-spring polymers for both folded and unfolded states. The pores were modeled as cylindrical holes through the membrane with various radii and lengths. Diffusion was driven by a concentration gradient created across the porous membrane. Our results for both folded and unfolded configurations show the expected reciprocal relation between the flow rate and the pore length in agreement with an analytical solution derived by Brunn et al. [Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 37, 311 (1984)]10.1093/qjmam/37.2.311. Furthermore, we find that the geometric constriction by the narrow pore leads to an accumulation of proteins at the pore entrance, which in turn compensates for the reduced diffusivity of the proteins inside the pore.},

	abstract = {Some effective models of water (TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E, TIP4P) and methanol (OPLS, H1) are studied with the help of the molecular Ornstein–Zernike (MOZ) theory using the hypernetted chain (HNC) approximation. The quality of the results obtained within the HNC approximation is discussed by comparison with values from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MOZ-HNC theory yields internal excess energies and dielectric constants which are about 20\% smaller than the simulation results found in the literature. The relative trends of the properties observed by simulation for the different interaction models are correctly predicted. In order to calculate the rotational invariant coefficients which define the liquid structure, new MD simulations were carried out. The rotational invariant coefficients derived from the simulation and from the MOZ theory strongly differ. In particular, the center–center distribution functions show that the theory is not able to reproduce the tetrahedral structure of water. In this solvent a comparison of the O–H distribution function indicates that the MOZ theory underestimates the H bonding. The use of a spherically symmetric bridge function in the reference HNC approximation does not lead to an improvement of the MOZ results. The observed defects of the MOZ-HNC approach contrast with the good agreement found for aprotic solvents and are presumably due to the association by H bonds in water and methanol. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

The principal results of this work are computationally simple techniques for calculating the thermo‐dynamic properties and pair correlation functions of molecular fluids in which the intermolecular interactions are highly angular dependent. The techniques should be reliable since they arise from the same approximations that have been shown to be very accurate when applied to simple fluids.},

	abstract = {We measure H2O dynamics in a well-defined synthetic hectorite clay by the neutron spin echo technique, in the temperature range 240K and 347K. The interlayer spaces of this anisotropic material contain two layers of confined water, corresponding to the so-called bihydrated state. We analyze the experimental data in light of parallel molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations demonstrate that H2O diffusion in the direction perpendicular to the clay layers is not negligible and has to be taken into account in the experimental data analysis. A diffusive model with only two fitting parameters D? and D// is well adapted for such analysis. A clear physical meaning for the two fitting parameters exists, in view of the geometry of the system. Experimentally, the diffusion coefficients parallel to the clay layers D// were estimated to be slowed down by a factor of 5 compared to bulk water. Further, the activation energy of the diffusion process is higher than in bulk water especially towards the lower temperatures within the range studied (20.3 kJ/mol above 300K increasing to 28.4 kJ/mol below 300K). Simulations suggest that this is connected to the presence of the cations (1 cation per every 8 water molecules) rather than to the formation of hydrogen bonds between H2O molecules and the clay layers. However improvements of microscopic force fields are necessary to achieve a full quantitative interpretation of the experimental water diffusion coefficients. We suggest the importance of polarizability in such endeavours.},

It represents an analysis of the correlation function in terms of the longitudinal and transverse momentum current densities and correctly describes both the long and short time behaviour. The authors have applied the result to a model of liquid rubidium in order to see how the collective modes in the system influence the individual particle motion. It is found that the longitudinal current component is responsible for the oscillatory behaviour of the velocity autocorrelation function; the principle peak in the associated frequency spectrum is generated by the coupling of the particle velocity to the transverse current; the coupling to the longitudinal current produces the peak or shoulder at higher frequencies which is observed in computer experiments; and the diffusion coefficient is determined almost entirely by the transverse current component.},

This procedure allows us to examine approximations underlying popular embedding theories for excited states. Finally, we introduce an approximate action functional for the solute-water system and compute the solvatochromic shift of the lowest singlet excited state of formaldehyde in aqueous solution, which is in good agreement with experimental findings.},

Opuscules de Physique Animale et Vegetale 1787 , 2 , 203 - 285 )] stimulated research that still continues to this day. Cryptobiosis, the ability of an organism to tolerate adverse environments, such as dehydration and low temperatures, still represents an unsolved and fascinating problem. It has been shown that many sugars play an important role as bioprotectant agents, and among the best performers is the disaccharide trehalose. The current hypothesis links the efficiency of its protective role to strong modifications of the tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules in the sugar hydration shell, with trehalose forming many hydrogen bonds with the solvent. Here, we show, by means of state-of-the-art neutron diffraction experiments combined with EPSR simulations, that trehalose solvation induces very minor modifications of the water structure. Moreover, the number of water molecules hydrogen-bonded to the sugar is surprisingly small.},

The chromium segregation in the surface was confirmed by in-situ heating at 973 K under ultra high vacuum. The effective thickness of its segregated zone was evaluated to be less than 1 nm, from the relationship between the concentration of iron and chromium and the take-off angle in AR-XPS. The effective concentration of segregated chromium was estimated a few times as much as the bulk concentration. The surface with the chromium segregation was subsequently exposed to air, and an oxide film formed on the surface was also characterized. The oxide film formed on the surface with the chromium segregation was found to be thinner than the case without segregation. These results on the surface layer were consistent with spectral information of the chemical state denoted by Fe 2p and Cr 2p.},

	abstract = {Local moment disorder, defined as a random arrangement of two distinct magnetic states of the same atomic species in a metallic system, is discussed in the framework of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent-potential approximation combined with the local-density-functional method and applied to Fe-Cr, Ni-Fe, and Ni-Mn alloys. For Fe-Cr alloys it is found that the disordered-moment state has a higher energy than the ferromagnetic state in the entire region of Fe concentrations. Thus the theory fails to explain the spin-glass state observed around Fe0.14Cr0.86. The theory, on the other hand, can explain the transition of Ni-Fe alloys from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism around the Invar region; the transition, however, is of first order, in contrast to experimental indications. The volume contraction due to the reversal of the magnetic-moment alignment from parallel to antiparallel with respect to the bulk magnetization is also discussed in connection with the Invar anomalies. For Ni-Mn alloys the calculation shows that, when the Mn concentration is larger than 15 at. \%, magnetic states with local moments parallel and antiparallel to the average magnetization coexist even in the ferromagnetic region. The results are quite consistent with NMR experiments, which clearly show the existence of the antiparallel Mn local moments in addition to the parallel ones.},

	abstract = {Oxygen-containing functional groups can be present in considerable amount intentionally or unintentionally on graphene, and a complete reduction of graphene oxide is difficult to achieve. To address the origin of this behavior, we have performed pseudopotential density functional theory calculations to investigate in particular the adsorption of hydroxyl (OH) on perfect and defected graphene, individually and in the presence of other coadsorbed functional groups. We found that hydroxyl groups weakly adsorb on perfect graphene, easily aggregate, also with coadsorbed epoxy groups, and can react with each other with a barrier of about 0.5 eV forming water. Defect sites are more reactive for OH adsorption but play different roles. At variance with single vacancy defects where the OH adsorption is highly dissociative, Stone?Wales defects could stabilize the hydroxyl groups on the graphene basal plane, with a much stronger binding and higher barriers for recombination and water formation than pristine.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a simple Monte Carlo method for simulating the dynamics of a crowd. Within our model a collection of hard-disk agents is subjected to a series of two-stage steps, implying (i) the displacement of one specific agent followed by (ii) a rearrangement of the rest of the group through a Monte Carlo dynamics. The rules for the combined steps are determined by the specific setting of the granular flow, so that our scheme should be easily adapted to describe crowd dynamics issues of many sorts, from stampedes in panic scenarios to organized flow around obstacles or through bottlenecks. We validate our scheme by computing the serving times statistics of a group of agents crowding to be served around a desk. In the case of a size homogeneous crowd, we recover intuitive results prompted by physical sense. However, as a further illustration of our theoretical framework, we show that heterogeneous systems display a less obvious behavior, as smaller agents feature shorter serving times. Finally, we analyze our results in the light of known properties of nonequilibrium hard-disk fluids and discuss general implications of our model.},

We find that the force constant of the pure liquid undergoes a pronounced softening at intermediate wave vectors (kσ≂2π, where σ is the solvent molecular diameter). An analysis of the modification of the solvent polarization force constant because of the presence of a polar solute molecule is also presented. In agreement with the calculation of Carter and Hynes, we find that this modificaton is a nonlinear effect. In the present density‐functional theory, the contribution of the solute enters through the space‐ and orientation‐dependent triplet direct correlation function. We use the convolution approximation of the triplet direct correlation function to derive an analytic expression for the solute‐induced contribution to both free energy and force constant. A preliminary numerical calculation shows that the long‐wavelength (k→0) force constant increases because of the presence of the solute, which is in agreement with Carter and Hynes and also with Kakitani and Mataga. The significance of these results in charge transfer processes in a dipolar liquid is discussed.},

The equivalent conductivity and self-diffusion coefficient show minima as the function of the number density of ions when the dielectric constant of the solvent is low. Although the minimum of the former is in harmony with various experiments, no experiment has ever been reported on that of the latter. The analysis of time-dependent transport coefficients reveals that the presence of the minima is ascribed to the slow dynamics, rather than to static association models. The inclusion of a model function that resembles the short-range part of the potential of mean force induced by solvent affects the transport coefficients qualitatively, which suggests the importance of solvent-induced potential of mean force in the conduction mechanism of electrolytes in solvents of low dielectric constant.},

In such nanoscale confinement, water has unusual physical properties that are exploited in biology and hold promise for a wide range of biomimetic and nanotechnological applications. The latter can be realized by carbon and boron nitride nanotubes which confine water in a relatively non-specific way and lend themselves to the study of intrinsic properties of single-file water. As a consequence of strong water–water hydrogen bonds, many characteristics of single-file water are conserved in biological and synthetic pores despite differences in their atomistic structures. Charge transport and orientational order in water chains depend sensitively on and are mainly determined by electrostatic effects. Thus, mimicking functions of biological pores with apolar pores and corresponding external fields gives insight into the structure–function relation of biological pores and allows the development of technical applications beyond the molecular devices found in living systems. In this Perspective, we revisit results for single-file water in apolar pores, and examine the similarities and the differences between these simple systems and water in more complex pores.},

While there has been extensive work showing the value of molecular modeling with interatomic potentials to predict molten salt properties there have been very limited studies of molten salts from a fully first-principles approach. In order to establish optimal approaches and their strengths and limitations in first-principles molten salt modeling, this work provides extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of the LiCl–KCl molten salt system that are validated against existing literature. The basic thermokinetic properties of volume, thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and diffusivity, are calculated for LiCl, KCl and the eutectic LiCl–KCl liquids at multiple temperatures. Convergence testing reveals 216-atom unit cells and simulation times of 6–12 ps are sufficient to provide results with acceptable uncertainties and agreement with experimental data. The results provide a framework of first principles molecular dynamics simulations in the LiCl–KCl molten salt system that can be extended in future research to predict less well-established properties, e.g., the behavior of solutes.},

	abstract = {Osmosis describes the flow of water across semipermeable membranes powered by the chemical free energy extracted from salinity gradients. While osmosis can be expressed in simple terms via the van ’t Hoff ideal gas formula for the osmotic pressure, it is a complex phenomenon taking its roots in the subtle interactions occurring at the scale of the membrane nanopores. Here we use new opportunities offered by nanofluidic systems to create an osmotic diode exhibiting asymmetric water flow under reversal of osmotic driving. We show that a surface charge asymmetry built on a nanochannel surface leads to nonlinear couplings between water flow and the ion dynamics, which are capable of water flow rectification. This phenomenon opens new opportunities for water purification and complex flow control in nanochannels.},

The simulation was performed using two different cohesive models that predict a different mixing enthalpy to see the effect on the precipitation kinetics. The evolution of the precipitate number density and size distributions has been followed during thermal annealing of the Fe-11.8Cr at 673 K.

A solution of positively charged polyelectrolytes is confined between two negatively charged planar surfaces, and an electric field is applied parallel to the surfaces. When electrostatic attraction between the polymer and the surface is strong, the polymers adhere to the surface, forming a highly viscous adsorption layer that greatly suppresses the electro-osmosis. Conversely, electro-osmosis is enhanced by depleting the polymers from the surfaces. We also found that the electro-osmotic flow is invertible when the electrostatic potential decays to its bulk value with the opposite sign. These behaviors are well explained by a simple mathematical form of the electro-osmotic coefficient.},

The crossover occurs on nanometer length scales, when the local concentration of apolar units is sufficiently high, or when an apolar surface is sufficiently large.

Good practice in the assessment process is essential, particularly as datasets from many different sources may be combined together into a single database. With this in mind, we highlight some problems that can arise during the assessment process and we propose a quality assurance procedure. It is worth mentioning at this point, that the provision of reliable assessed thermodynamic data relies heavily on the availability of high quality experimental information.

For the clean Fe(001) surface we demonstrate that the correct tunneling spectrum is only obtained in a full potential treatment, while the atomic-sphere approximation yields incorrect results. For 3d impurities in the surface layer, peaks appear in the spectra due to surfacelike states localized on the impurity site. Our results can explain recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on Cr impurities in the Fe(001) surface, and predict that chemical identification is also possible for many other transition-metal impurities.},

	abstract = {An equilibrium theory of rigid sphere fluids is developed based on the properties of a new distribution functionG(r) which measures the density of rigid sphere molecules in contact with a rigid sphere solute of arbitrary size. A number of exact relations which describe rather fully the functional form of G(r) are derived. These are based on both geometrical considerations and the virial theorem. A knowledge of G(a) where a is the diameter of a rigid sphere enables one to arrive at the equation of state. The resulting analytical expression which is exact up to the third virial coefficient gives the fourth virial coefficient within 3\% and the fifth, insofar as it is known, within 5\%. Furthermore over the entire range of fluid density, the equation of state derived from theory agrees with that computed using machine methods. Theory also gives an expression for the surface tension of a hard sphere fluid in contact with a perfectly repelling wall. The dependence of surface tension on curvature is also given. The expressions obtained correlate nicely with those adduced by other thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theories. They also suggest that macroscopic consideration on surface tension can sometimes be successfully extrapolated to molecular dimensions.},

	abstract = {The appearance of Cr-rich precipitates (α′ prime) after thermal aging or irradiation is a typical feature of high-Cr ferritic/martensitic steels. α′ particles, obstructing the motion of dislocations, are long known to be the cause of hardening and embrittlement, observed in steels and Fe-Cr binary alloys. In this work, we consider the interaction of a screw dislocation with Cr precipitates in a bcc Fe matrix using a molecular dynamics technique. We derive an interatomic potential, based on the existing two band formalism, specifically accounting for information about screw dislocation properties in the Fe-Cr system available from the first-principles calculations. The derived potential was accordingly benchmarked and successfully applied to study the interaction of a moving 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation with Cr precipitates. The results obtained suggest that two principally different interaction mechanisms may operate depending on the interatomic potential applied. The improved potential predicts stable glide of a screw dislocation, whereas the potential predicting an incorrect core structure shows the bypass movement of the dislocation around the precipitate without shearing of the latter. The bypass movement involves the glide of the dislocation under the precipitate in the plane inclined to the maximum resolved shear stress plane. The reasons for this were rationalized in terms of the compact-to-degenerate transformation of the structure occurring at the precipitate matrix interface. This study emphasizes the importance of the atomic scale features and dislocation core effects in the process of the interaction of a dislocation with secondary phase particles.},

An MRI visualization of the 3-D packing of spheres for which NMR data are obtained is used as the matrix for the simulation, thereby enabling a direct assessment of the ability of the lattice-Boltzmann method to quantitatively predict flow phenomena within porous media of complex geometry. By introducing normalized parameters, hydrodynamical dispersion over normalized displacement lengthscales extending over nearly four orders of magnitude is investigated and is shown to be dominated by mechanical dispersion over most of this range. At the largest lengthscales studied holdup may play a significant role in the hydrodynamics characteristic of the porous medium. Quantitative agreement between NMR measurements and the predictions of the lattice-Boltzmann simulation is obtained in all cases.},

B, 2010, 114, 12629?12631), previously validated against experimental data for a number of bulk properties, is used in molecular dynamics simulations of two different interfaces involving the ionic liquid [BMI][PF6]. First, simulations of the liquid?vapor interface demonstrate that the model is able to predict the surface tension of the fluid (for which we obtain a value of 39.4 mN·m?1 at 400 K). Second, simulations were performed at constant potential differences applied between two graphite electrodes. From simulations with different applied potentials, the differential capacitances of the positive and negative electrodes can be calculated. It appears that both capacitances (C+ = 3.9 ?F·cm?2 for the positive electrode and C? = 4.8 ?F·cm?2 for the negative electrode) agree very well with simulations results obtained with an all-atom model. The coarse-grained model also accurately reproduces the two-dimensional structure observed at the graphite?ionic liquid interface, namely, a defective hexagonal lattice with a lattice spacing of approximately 10 Å.},

Such groove-bound ions potentially could play an important role in AT-tract bending and groove narrowing, thereby modulating DNA function in vivo. To address this issue, we report here 23Na magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements on oligonucleotides, including difference experiments with the groove-binding drug netropsin. The exquisite sensitivity of this method to ions in long-lived and intimate association with DNA allows us to detect sequence-specific sodium ion binding in the minor groove AT tract of three B-DNA dodecamers. The sodium ion occupancy is only a few percent, however, and therefore is not likely to contribute importantly to the ensemble of B-DNA structures. We also report results of ion competition experiments, indicating that potassium, rubidium, and cesium ions bind to the minor groove with similarly weak affinity as sodium ions, whereas ammonium ion binding is somewhat stronger. The present findings are discussed in the light of previous NMR and diffraction studies of sequence-specific counterion binding to DNA.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

	abstract = {Classical density functional theory (DFT) of inhomogeneous fluids is applied to an explicit solvent ‘semi-primitive’ model (SPM) of ionic solutions to investigate the influence of ionic solutes on the wetting behaviour of a solvent in contact with a neutral or charged planar substrate. The SPM is made up of three species of hard sphere particles with different diameters, interacting via an attractive Yukawa potential to model excluded volume and cohesion. The solvent particles are neutral, while the monovalent anions and cations are oppositely charged. The polar nature of the solvent is modelled by a continuum dielectric permittivity linked to the local solvent density. All three species interact with the impenetrable substrate via an attractive external potential. While excluded volume effects are accurately described by a Rosenfeld ‘fundamental measure’ free energy functional, the short range Yukawa attraction and Coulombic interactions are treated within the mean-field approximation. The ionic solutes are found to have a significant impact on the wetting behaviour of the solvent, in particular on the wetting temperature. Strong electric fields, or long-ranged (weakly screened) Coulombic forces are shown to have the propensity to change the wetting transition from second to first order. The cation–anion size asymmetry leads to charge separation on the liquid–vapour interface of the solution, which in turn can induce a drying transition on the liquid side of liquid–vapour coexistence.},

	abstract = {We study the response of a model microelectrochemical cell to a large ac voltage of frequency comparable to the inverse cell relaxation time. To bring out the basic physics, we consider the simplest possible model of a symmetric binary electrolyte confined between parallel-plate blocking electrodes, ignoring any transverse instability or fluid flow. We analyze the resulting one-dimensional problem by matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of thin double layers and extend previous work into the strongly nonlinear regime, which is characterized by two features—significant salt depletion in the electrolyte near the electrodes and, at very large voltage, the breakdown of the quasiequilibrium structure of the double layers. The former leads to the prediction of “ac capacitive desalination” since there is a time-averaged transfer of salt from the bulk to the double layers, via oscillating diffusion layers. The latter is associated with transient diffusion limitation, which drives the formation and collapse of space-charge layers, even in the absence of any net Faradaic current through the cell. We also predict that steric effects of finite ion sizes (going beyond dilute-solution theory) act to suppress the strongly nonlinear regime in the limit of concentrated electrolytes, ionic liquids, and molten salts. Beyond the model problem, our reduced equations for thin double layers, based on uniformly valid matched asymptotic expansions, provide a useful mathematical framework to describe additional nonlinear responses to large ac voltages, such as Faradaic reactions, electro-osmotic instabilities, and induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena.},

This dynamics involves a complex transport scheme with a hierarchy of characteristic time and length scales, from analyte?surface interactions to effective macroscale transport behavior. Here we report on results obtained with a comprehensive modeling approach that combines three-dimensional pore-scale simulations of fluid flow and mass transport, i.e., advection?diffusion in the interstitial void space of a random packing of polydisperse hard spheres (representing a chromatographic bed) with the stochastic model of analyte sorption at the solid?liquid interface of the packing. The retention factor of an analyte is constructed by independent adjustment of the adsorption probability and the mean adsorption time. The approach can realize any microscopic model of the adsorption kinetics based on a distribution of adsorption sojourn times expressed in analytical or numerical form. We study the impact of the retention factor, adsorption probability, and distribution function for the adsorption sojourn times on the chromatographic plate height in dependence of the mobile phase flow velocity. Our results show that the randomness of both the sorption event and the adsorption sojourn time affect peak broadening. For a given retention factor and flow velocity, a reduction of the average adsorption time leads to a decrease in plate height. This work recovers that models of adsorption chromatography cannot describe the separation process adequately without addressing the microscopic details of sorption at the solid?liquid interface.},

In the metastable liquid region, theory has hypothesized the existence of a liquid-liquid critical point from which a dividing line separates two water species of high and low density. A recent small-angle X-ray scattering study has claimed that the two structural species postulated in the supercooled state are seen to exist in bulk water at ambient conditions. We analyze new small-angle X-ray scattering data on ambient liquid water taken at third generation synchrotron sources, and large 32,000 water molecule simulations using the TIP4P-Ew model of water, to show that the small-angle region measures standard number density fluctuations consistent with water’s isothermal compressibility temperature trends. Our study shows that there is no support or need for heterogeneities in water structure at room temperature to explain the small-angle scattering data, as it is consistent with a unimodal density of the tetrahedral liquid at ambient conditions.},

Experiment and simulation are compared both directly on the level of intermediate scattering functions, I(Q, t), and indirectly on the level of relaxation times after a model of atomic motion is applied. Regarding the dynamics of water in Na- and Cs-monohydrated montmorillonite samples, the simulation and NSE results show a very good agreement, both indicating diffusion coefficients of the order of (1?3) ? 10-10 m2 s-1. The TOF technique significantly underestimates water relaxation times (therefore overestimates water dynamics), by a factor of up to 3 and 7 in the two systems, respectively, primarily due to insufficiently long correlation times being probed. In the case of the Na-bihydrated system, the TOF results are in closer agreement with the other two techniques (the techniques differ by a factor of 2?3 at most), giving diffusion coefficients of (5?10) ? 10-10 m2 s-1. Attention has been also paid to the elastic incoherent structure factor, EISF(Q). Simulation has played a key role in understanding the various contributions to EISF(Q) in clay systems and in clearly distinguishing the signatures of ?apparent? and true confinement. Indirectly, simulation highlights the difficulty in interpreting the EISF(Q) signal from powder clay samples used in experiments.},

In recognition of Roger Staehle's interests and contributions, these processes are considered from the scientific and technological perspectives. In this paper, current understanding of the aging of airframe aluminum alloys is summarized. A possible resolution of the long-standing dichotomy between the nucleation and crack growth (and dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement) approaches to corrosion fatigue is proposed. The use of a simplified, mechanistically based probabilistic model that integrates the individual processes is presented. Its application to the assessment of damage evolution and distribution and correlation with long-term service data are discussed. The approach is assessed against the statistically based approaches. The paper provides an overall perspective for a multidisciplinary approach for understanding and for integrating information for structural integrity and reliability analyses.},

	abstract = {The prediction of protein?ligand binding free energies is an important goal of computational biochemistry, yet accuracy, reproducibility, and cost remain a problem. Nevertheless, these are essential requirements for computational methods to become standard binding prediction tools in discovery pipelines. Here, we present the results of an extensive search for an optimal method based on an ensemble of umbrella sampling all-atom molecular simulations tested on the phosphorylated tetrapeptide, pYEEI, binding to the SH2 domain, resulting in an accurate and converged binding free energy of ?9.0 ± 0.5 kcal/mol (compared to an experimental value of ?8.0 ± 0.1 kcal/mol). We find that a minimum of 300 ns of sampling is required for every prediction, a target easily achievable using new generation accelerated MD codes. Convergence is obtained by using an ensemble of simulations per window, each starting from different initial conformations, and by optimizing window-width, orthogonal restraints, reaction coordinate harmonic potentials, and window-sample time. The use of uncorrelated initial conformations in neighboring windows is important for correctly sampling conformational transitions from the unbound to bound states that affect significantly the precision of the calculations. This methodology thus provides a general recipe for reproducible and practical computations of binding free energies for a class of semirigid protein?ligand systems, within the limit of the accuracy of the force field used.},

Here we show that the diffusion is characterized by a hierarchy of time scales arising from ion confinement, solvation, and electrosorption effects. By combining electrochemistry experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the in-pore conductivities and diffusion coefficients and their variations with the applied potential. We show that the diffusion of the ions is slower by 1 order of magnitude compared to the bulk electrolyte. The desolvation of the ions occurs on much faster time scales than electrosorption.},

Cluster distributions obtained from both neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations point to significantly enhanced segregation as the mixtures are cooled or compressed. This evolution toward greater molecular heterogenity in the mixture accounts for the observed changes in the water-water radial distribution function and there are indications also of a change in the topology of the water clusters. The observed behavior is consistent with an approach to an upper critical solution point. Such a point would appear to be "hidden" below the freezing line, thereby precluding observation of the two-fluid region.},

In contrast, the magnitude of fluctuations in a normal liquid, such as CCl4, exhibits no enhancement with decreasing temperature, as is also the case for water from molecular dynamics simulations under ambient conditions. Based on X-ray emission spectroscopy and X-ray Raman scattering data we propose that the density difference contrast in SAXS is due to fluctuations between tetrahedral-like and hydrogen-bond distorted structures related to, respectively, low and high density water. We combine our experimental observations to propose a model of water as a temperature-dependent, fluctuating equilibrium between the two types of local structures driven by incommensurate requirements for minimizing enthalpy (strong near-tetrahedral hydrogen-bonds) and maximizing entropy (nondirectional H-bonds and disorder). The present results provide experimental evidence that the extreme differences anticipated in the hydrogen-bonding environment in the deeply supercooled regime surprisingly remain in bulk water even at conditions ranging from ambient up to close to the boiling point.},

The obtained potential was used for the determination of the defect structures, e.g., a vacancy-Cr complex (V-Cr) and a self-interstitial atom (SIA-Cr) complex (I-Cr). The binding energy of this complex is very small, i.e., 26 meV, which is not contradictory to the experimental result, namely, less than 105 meV obtained in the muon experiment and the vacancy migration temperature obtained by the positron annihilation lifetime experiment, i.e., about 200 K for both pure Fe and Fe-Cr alloy. Calculations were made for the various types of I-Cr complexes, but mixed dumbbell type complex is not the most stable structure.

	abstract = {An understanding of water's anomalies is closely linked to an understanding of the phase diagram of water's metastable noncrystalline states. Despite the considerable effort, such an understanding has remained elusive and many puzzles regarding phase transitions in supercooled liquid water and their possible amorphous proxies at low temperatures remain. Here, decompression of very high density amorphous ice (VHDA) from 1.1 to 0.02 GPa at 140 K is studied by means of dilatometry and powder x-ray diffraction of quench-recovered states. It is shown that the three amorphous states of ice are reversibly connected to each other, i.e., LDA{\textless}--{\textgreater}e-HDA{\textless}--{\textgreater}VHDA. However, while the downstroke VHDA--{\textgreater}e-HDA transition takes place in the pressure range of 0.06 GPaLDA transition takes place quasi-discontinuously at p approximately 0.06 GPa. That is, two amorphous-amorphous transitions of a distinct nature are observed for the first time in a one-component system-a first-order-like transition (e-HDA--{\textgreater}LDA) and a transition which is not first-order like but possibly of higher order (VHDA--{\textgreater}e-HDA). VHDA and e-HDA are established as the most stable and limiting states in the course of the transition. We interpret this as evidence disfavoring the hypothesis of multiple first-order liquid-liquid transitions (and the option of a third critical point), but favoring a single first-order liquid-liquid transition (and the option of a second critical point).},

	abstract = {The flow characterization of blood through healthy and diseased flow geometries is of interest to researchers and clinicians alike, as it may allow for early detection, and monitoring, of cardiovascular disease. In this paper, we use a numerically efficient particle-based flow model called multiparticle collision dynamics (MPC for short) to study the effect of compressibility and slip of flow of a Newtonian fluid through a cylinder with a local constriction. We use a cumulative averaging method to compare our MPC results to the finite-element solution of the incompressible no-slip Navier-Stokes equations in the same geometry. We concentrate on low Reynolds number flows [[Formula: see text]] and quantify important differences observed between the MPC results and the Navier-Stokes solution in constricted geometries. In particular, our results show that upstream recirculating zones can form with the inclusion of slip and compressibility, which are not observed in the flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid using the no-slip assumption, but have been observed experimentally for blood. Important flow features are also presented that could be used as indicators to observe compressibility and slip in experimental data where near-wall data may be difficult to obtain. Finally, we found that the cumulative averaging method used is ideal for steady particle-based flow methods, as macroscopic no-slip is readily obtained using the MPC bounce-back rule. Generally, a small spurious slip is seen using other averaging methods such as weighted spatial averages or averages over several runs, and the bounce-back rule has to be modified so as to achieve macroscopic no-slip. No modifications of the bounce-back rule were required for our simulations.},

The experiments were carried out using the high intensity total scattering time-of-flight spectrometer, HIT-II, at the KENS spallation neutron source in Japan. The experimental data are very reliable, with the possible exception of the small momentum transfer region, whose accessibility is limited by neutron energy and detector positions. The simulations made use of the semiempirical rigid ion potentials of the Vashishta-Rahman [Phys. Rev. Lett.40, 1337 (1978)] type using a new set of parameters appropriate for the mixture. Within the known constraints of the pairwise rigid ion potentials, the simulated structure factors are in fair agreement with experiment.

The reason for this limitation is the neglect of orientational and distance correlations beyond the particle diameter. In the current article we resolve this restriction and generalize the fundamental measure theory to an expansion in intersection centers. It is shown that the intersection probability of particle systems is described by an algebra, represented by Rosenfeld's weight functions. For subdiagrams of intersection networks we derive vertex functions that provide the building blocks for the free energy functional. Their application is illustrated by deriving the Rosenfeld functional and its leading correction which is exact in the third virial order. Furthermore, the methods are used to derive an approximate functional for the infinite sum over Mayer ring diagrams. Comparing this result to the White Bear mark II functional, we find general agreement between both results.},

We describe the conditions under which the simple formula μav=μA0-x(10+ZB-ZA) can be expected to apply. In particular, we consider Fe- and Co-metalloid alloys. Here μav is the atom-averaged moment, μA0 is the host moment, x is the metalloid-atom fraction, and ZB and ZA are the valence of metalloid and transition metal, respectively. We show that the validity of this formula rests on the existence of band gaps in the density of states in the spin-up band. Spin-polarized band-structure calculations do indeed show band gaps in moderately concentrated (x∼0.25) compounds and indicate that μA0 should be somewhat higher for fcc than bcc structures. The theory compares well with data on concentrated amorphous and crystalline alloys of Co with Au, B, Sn, and P, and of Fe with Au, B, Al, Ga, and Si. Our explanation of this large amount of data is far simpler than, and as accurate as, any previous efforts at explanation.},

With nanometric pores the energy storage capacity is controlled by interfacial phenomena. With subnanometric pores, we demonstrate that a breakdown occurs with the emergence of molecular exclusion as a leading contribution. This bulk exclusion effect leads to an osmotic contribution to the pressure that can reach levels never previously sustained. We illustrate, on various electrolytes and different microporous materials, that a simple osmotic pressure law accounts quantitatively for the enhancement of the intrusion and extrusion pressures governing the forced wetting and spontaneous drying of the nanopores. Using electrolyte solutions, energy storage and power capacities can be widely enhanced.},

	abstract = {We describe an algorithm for simulating reactive flows in porous media, in which the pore space is mapped explicitly. Chemical reactions at the solid–fluid boundaries lead to dissolution (or precipitation), which makes it necessary to track the movement of the solid–fluid interface during the course of the simulation. We have developed a robust algorithm for constructing a piecewise continuous (C1) surface, which enables a rapid remapping of the surface to the grid lines. The key components of the physics are the Navier–Stokes equations for fluid flow in the pore space, the convection–diffusion equation to describe the transport of chemical species, and rate equations to model the chemical kinetics at the solid surfaces. A lattice-Boltzmann model was used to simulate fluid flow in the pore space, with linear interpolation at the solid boundaries. A finite-difference scheme for the concentration field was developed, taking derivatives along the direction of the local fluid velocity. When the flow is not aligned with the grid this leads to much more accurate convective fluxes and surface concentrations than a standard Cartesian template. A robust algorithm for the surface reaction rates has been implemented, avoiding instabilities when the surface is close to a grid point. We report numerical tests of different aspects of the algorithm and assess the overall convergence of the method.},

In this way, molecular dynamics trajectories consistent with the nonequilibrium dynamics of interest are generated efficiently. Using results of this sampling, we demonstrate that statistics of the energy gap between a solute’s electronic states are Gaussian throughout the dynamics of nonequilibrium solvation in water. However, these statistics do change in time, reflecting linear response that is nonstationary. Discrepancies observed between the dynamics of nonequilibrium relaxation and of equilibrium fluctuations are thus explained. We analyze a simple Gaussian field theory that accounts for this nonstationary response. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {The molybdenumiron (MoFe) protein of nitrogenase contains two unique metalloclusters called P-cluster [8Fe-7S] and M-center (FeMo cofactor, [7Fe-9S-Mo-homocitrate]). Using samples containing M-centers selectively enriched with 57Fe (57M56P), we have studied three M-center states with Mssbauer spectroscopy. The results are as follows. A detailed analysis of the Mssbauer spectra of the S = 3/2 state MN recorded in applied fields up to 8.0 T has revealed the features of the seventh Fe site which had eluded previous Mssbauer and ENDOR studies. This site has unusually small and anisotropic magnetic hyperfine interactions (Aiso 4 MHz). Our studies have also revealed that the spectroscopic component previously labeled B1 represents two equivalent Fe sites. Six of the M-center irons are trigonally coordinated to bridging sulfides; their unusual isomer shifts are discussed with particular reference to a trigonally coordinated Fe(II) thiolate complex synthesized by Power and co-workers (Inorg. Chem. 1995, 34, 18151822). The unusually low isomer shifts (av = 0.41 mm/s) of MN suggest that the core of the M-center is (formally) best described as (Mo4+-3Fe3+-4Fe2+). The turnover complex MR is one electron further reduced than MN. While av changes by 0.06 mm/s between the one-electron oxidized state MOX and MN, only a small change in av, 0.02 mm/s, is observed between MN and MR. Moreover, spectra of the integer-spin state MR taken in strong applied magnetic fields are quite similar to those observed for MN, suggesting that the 7-Fe segment of the M-center has the same spin structure in both states. These observations suggest that the reduction MN MR is associated mainly with the molybdenum site. In a preliminary experiment, we have also observed reduction of the M-cluster (ca. 40\%) by irradiating a 57M56P sample at 77 K in a synchrotron X-ray beam. The radiolytically reduced state, MI, has integer electronic spin S 1, and its reduction appears to be centered on the iron components of the cluster.},

Such correlations result in severe difficulties in interpreting light scattering measurements in the determination of the molecular weight, radius of gyration, and the second virial coefficient of charged macromolecules at lower ionic strengths from added strong electrolytes. By accounting for charge-regularization of the polyelectrolyte by the counterions, we present a theory of the apparent molecular weight, second virial coefficient, and the intermolecular structure factor in dilute polyelectrolyte solutions in terms of concentrations of the polymer and the added strong electrolyte. The counterion adsorption of the polyelectrolyte chains to differing levels at different concentrations of the strong electrolyte can lead to even an order of magnitude discrepancy in the molecular weight inferred from light scattering measurements. Based on counterion-mediated charge regularization, the second virial coefficient of the polyelectrolyte and the interchain structure factor are derived self-consistently. The effect of the interchain correlations, dominating at lower salt concentrations, on the inference of the radius of gyration and on molecular weight is derived. Conditions for the onset of nonmonotonic scattering wave vector dependence of scattered intensity upon lowering the electrolyte concentration and interpretation of the apparent radius of gyration are derived in terms of the counterion adsorption mechanism.},

	abstract = {The concentration dependence of self-diffusion of ions in solutions at large concentrations has remained an interesting yet unsolved problem. Here we develop a self-consistent microscopic approach based on the ideas of mode-coupling theory. It allows us to calculate both contributions which influence the friction of a moving ion: the ion atmosphere relaxation and hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting theory provides an excellent agreement with known experimental results over a wide concentration range. Interestingly, the mode-coupling self-consistent calculation of friction reveal a nonlinear coupling between the hydrodynamic interactions and the ion atmosphere relaxation which enhances ion diffusion by reducing friction, particularly at intermediate ion concentrations. This rather striking result has its origin in the similar time scales of the relaxation of the ion atmosphere relaxation and the hydrodynamic term, which are essentially given by the Debye relaxation time. The results are also in agreement with computer simulations, with and without hydrodynamic interactions.},

J. Chem. Phys. 124, 084905 (2006)
]. In the level-set method, a possible solute-solvent interface is represented by the zero level set (i.e., the zero level surface) of a level-set function and is eventually evolved into the equilibrium solute-solvent interface. The evolution law is determined by minimization of a solvation free energy functional that couples both the interfacial energy and the van der Waals type solute-solvent interaction energy. The surface evolution is thus an energy minimizing process, and the equilibrium solute-solvent interface is an output of this process. The method is implemented and applied to the solvation of nonpolar molecules such as two xenon atoms, two parallel paraffin plates, helical alkane chains, and a single fullerence C60. The level-set solutions show good agreement for the solvation energies when compared to available molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, the method captures solvent dewetting (nanobubble formation) and quantitatively describes the interaction in the strongly hydrophobic plate system.},

We consider a situation where the typical pattern size is smaller than the channel height and the local boundary conditions at wetting and nonwetting regions are characterized by finite slip lengths. In the case of anisotropic patterns, transverse flow profiles are reported for flows over alternating stripes of different wettability when the shear flow direction is misaligned with respect to the stripe orientation. The angular dependence of the effective slip length obtained from MD simulations is in good agreement with hydrodynamic predictions provided that the stripe width is larger than several molecular diameters. We found that the longitudinal component of the slip velocity along the shear flow direction is proportional to the interfacial diffusion coefficient of fluid monomers in that direction at equilibrium. In case of random textures, the effective slip length and the diffusion coefficient of fluid monomers in the first layer near the heterogeneous surface depend sensitively on the total area of wetting regions.},

The parameters are the chemical shift, the shielding anisotropy, the asymmetry parameter of shielding, the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant, and the asymmetry parameter of the nuclear quadrupole coupling. We sample instantaneous configurations from a Car?Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation and feed nuclear coordinates into a quantum chemical program for the calculation of NMR parameters using density-functional theory with the three-parameter hybrid exchange-correlation (B3LYP) functional. In the subsequent analysis, molecules are divided into groups according to the number of hydrogen bonds they possess, and the full average NMR tensors are calculated separately for each group. The classification of the hydrogen-bonding cases is performed using a simple distance-based criterion. The analysis reveals in detail how the NMR tensors evolve as the environment changes gradually from gas to liquid upon increasing the number of hydrogen bonds to the molecule of interest. Liquid-state distributions of the instantaneous values of the NMR properties show a wide range of values for each hydrogen-bonding species with significant overlap between the different cases. Our study shows how local changes in the environment, along with classical thermal averaging, affect the NMR parameters in liquid water. For example, a broken or alternatively extra hydrogen bond induces major changes in the NMR tensors, and the effect is more pronounced for hydrogen or deuterium than for oxygen. The data sheds light on the usefulness of NMR experiments in investigating the local coordination of liquid water.},

	abstract = {A detailed theoretical study of solvation dynamics in water is presented. The motivation of the present study comes from the recent experimental observation that the dynamics of solvation of an ion in water is ultrafast and the solvation time correlation function decays with a time constant of about 55 fs. The slower decay in the long time can be described by a sum of two exponentials with time constants equal to 126 and 880 fs. The molecular theory (developed earlier) predicts a time constant equal to 52 fs for the initial Gaussian decay and time constants equal to 134 and 886 fs for the two exponential components at the long time. This nearly perfect agreement is obtained by using the most detailed dynamical information available in the literature. The present study emphasizes the importance of the intermolecular vibrational band originating from the O...O stretching mode of the O–H...O units in the initial dynamics and raises several interesting questions regarding the nature of the decay of this mode. We have also studied the effects of isotope substitution on solvation dynamics. It is predicted that a significant isotope effect may be observed in the long time. The experimental results have also been compared with the prediction of the dynamic mean spherical approximation (DMSA); the agreement is not satisfactory at the long time. It is further found that the molecular theory and the DMSA lead to virtually identical results if the translational modes of the solvent molecules are neglected in the former. DMSA has also been used to investigate the dynamics of solvation of a dipolar solute in water. It is found that the dynamics of dipolar solvation exhibit features rather different from those of ion solvation. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

The results are nearly independent of the number (up to 500) of particles investigated, even at large values of the dipole moment. The dielectric constants obtained from the approximate solution of the hypernetted chain integral equation are considerably larger than the molecular dynamics results except at low dielectric constants.

Because the PPPM method discretizes the field equations and utilizes the highly efficient fast Fourier transform algorithm, it requires significantly less computational effort than the Ewald method and scales almost linearly with system size. In this paper, we take a more detailed look into the theory behind the lattice‐sum methods to clarify the underlying similarities between the Ewald method and the PPPM method. We also investigate the errors introduced by different approximation used in the discretization of the field equations in the PPPM method.},

The computed isotherms for the exchange of sodium in NaY faujasite by lithium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium ions, respectively, are in good agreement with the experimental ones. They display the three main types of behavior observed in zeolites, namely, a monotonous evolution of selectivity throughout the exchange process (Li+), a selectivity reversal (K+), and an incomplete exchange (Rb+ and Cs+). The initial stage of the cation exchange is shown to be dominated by the hydration energy of the cations in the external aqueous solution. The final part of the process is often dominated by the cation?framework and cation?cation interactions. A crossover between these two regimes explains the frequently observed reversal of selectivity phenomenon. The incomplete exchange observed in the case of Rb+ and Cs+ is shown to correspond to a blocked state of the system for highest accessible composition of the aqueous solution. This stable state is shown not to be linked to an inability of the cesium cations to cross the six-ring window in order to penetrate into the smallest cages.},

	abstract = {The solvation free energy of polar and nonpolar molecules in water is examined using the statistical mechanical integral equation theory which was recently introduced by Beglov and Roux (J. Phys. Chem. 1997, 101, 7821). The integral equation is an extension of previous theories based on the reference interaction site model (RISM) and the hypernetted chain equation (HNC) to determine the one-dimensional site?site radial pair correlation functions. Since the integral equation provides the average density of the solvent interaction sites in three-dimensional (3d) space around a complex molecular solute of arbitrary shape, it is thereby referred to as the 3d-RISM-HNC integral equation. In the present paper, the accuracy of the 3d-RISM-HNC integral equation is examined by comparing the calculated excess solvation free energy at infinite dilution with experimental data for a set of nonpolar (n-alkanes) and polar (n-alcohols, n-carboxylic acids, and simple amides) molecules. Thermodynamic integration is used to calculate the excess solvation free energy on the basis of the average site densities obtained by the 3d-RISM-HNC equation. Two extensions were made to improve the accuracy of the integral equation. First, the susceptibility of pure liquid water (an input for calculating the excess solvation free energy of molecules in the infinite dilution limit) was obtained by combining information from a molecular dynamics simulation with the RISM-HNC integral equation. Second, empirical water hydrogen and water oxygen bridge functions were introduced and optimized for improving the accuracy of the theory. The calculated solvation free energies are in good accord with experimental data, although further work will be required for quantitatively accurate results. These preliminary results indicate that the 3d-RISM-HNC equation with well-calibrated optimized bridge functions is a promising approach for calculating the hydration free energy of complex molecules.},

For a 2 ? 1 ? 1 expanded supercell for 0 ≤ x(Li) ≤ 1, the intercalation voltage is minimized for x(Li) = 0.5. The low-energy structures display a common structural motif of edge-sharing pairs of LiO6 octahedra, which allows all Li to adopt favorable oxygen coordination. Long-ranged disorder of these subunits explains the apparent random Li distribution seen in experimental diffraction data.},

We perform magnetoresistance, electronic transport, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetization measurements on TiC-CDC samples prepared at different chlorination temperatures. Transport reveals a metal-insulator transition where high (low) chlorination temperature samples are on the metallic (insulating) side of the transition. Magnetoresistance measurements are consistent with transport in the weak and strong localization regimes for metallic and insulating samples, respectively. Changes in diamagnetism, electronic transport, and magnetoresistance data across the metal-insulator transition are coordinated, suggesting that all three properties are controlled by a single parameter, likely the expansion of sp2-bonded domains.},

It involves use of a predetermined, quantum mechanical, multidimensional property surface in a simulation. The results are used in conjunction with the simulated rotational correlation time to calculate the deuteron quadrupole coupling constant (DQCC), in an analogous approach to the one used by experimentalists, and to examine the surprising experimental findings for the composition dependence of the DQCC in the dimethyl sulfoxide/water mixture. Experiments have suggested that the DQCC for a mixture of 5\% dimethyl sulfoxide in water is close to the DQCC of ice, whereas its value increases to a value close to the gas value with further dilution.1 The results are further critically analyzed using combinations of different experimental and theoretical results from the literature.},

Continuum dielectric models often work well in describing the thermo- dynamic aspects of aqueous solvation, and approximations to such models that avoid the need to solve the Poisson equation are attractive because of their computational efficiency. Here we give an overview of one such approximation, the generalized Born model, which is simple and fast enough to be used for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. We discuss its strengths and weaknesses, both for its fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for its ability to replace explicit con- sideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations.

	abstract = {Energetic factors that govern intermixing and alloying at the Cr/Fe(100) interface are discussed and applied quantitatively in a model based on locally composition-dependent, surface enhanced Cr-Fe interactions. The calculations, employing the free-energy concentration expansion method without any adjustable energetic parameters, are in good agreement with scanning tunneling microscopy results for Cr growth on Fe(100), as reported previously by Davies et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 4175 (1996)]. Following a moderate, mixing related increase in Cr surface fraction, at ∼1 ML deposited Cr coverage, a sharp transition from a low ∼10\% value to ∼30\% Cr is predicted. This transition is closely associated with a change of sign in the composition dependent effective pair interactions reported for this system. According to the calculations for deposited coverages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2 ML, a pure Cr layer is separated at the surface, with 1–2 layer sharp interface and slightly Cr-mixed iron layers underneath. At submonolayer Cr deposited coverages only the latter, diffuse part of the interface prevails. Calculated short-range order pair probabilities at the alloy surface and in the bulk agree with experimental values.},

Here, we explore the thermodynamic stability and dipolar orientation of such 1D water chains from nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions. We show that a dipole lattice model accurately recovers key properties of 1D confined water when compared to atomically detailed simulations. In a major reduction in computational complexity, we represent the dipole model in terms of effective Coulombic charges, which allows us to study pores of macroscopic lengths in equilibrium with a water bath (or vapor). We find that at ambient conditions, the water chains filling the tube are essentially continuous up to macroscopic dimensions. At reduced water vapor pressure, we observe a 1D Ising-like filling/emptying transition without a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. In the filled state, the chains of water molecules in the tube remain dipole-ordered up to macroscopic lengths of ≈0.1 mm, and the dipolar order is estimated to persist for times up to ≈0.1 s. The observed dipolar order in continuous water chains is a precondition for the use of nanoconfined 1D water as mediator of fast long-range proton transport, e.g., in fuel cells. For water-filled nanotube bundles and membranes, we expect anti-ferroelectric behavior, resulting in a rich phase diagram similar to that of a 2D Coulomb gas.},

	abstract = {The mean spherical model (MSM) for dense fluids is solved for an arbitrary mixture of equal radii charged hard spheres with permanent embedded dipole moments. The model provides a treatment of ionic solutions that includes the feature of a molecular solvent. Thus, it gives a basis for investigating deviations from the familiar continuum dielectric model in ionic solutiontheory. The arbitrary polar‐ionic mixture is first reduced to an effective two component problem. One component is an effective charged species while the other is an effective polar species. This two component problem is solved in terms of three parameters closely related to the thermodynamic functions of the fluid. Nonlinear algebraic equations for these parameters are obtained. Although these equations appear to be analytically intractable for arbitrary ionic and dipolar strengths, explicit results are obtained for low ionic strength. In this limit, the ion‐ion contribution to the Helmholtz free energy is given by the classical Debye‐Hückel result. The dielectric constant in the Debye‐Hückel formula is that of the MSM polar fluid mixture that results if the ionic components of the polar‐ion solution are discharged. The self‐energy of charging, however, differs from the classical result. The model also exhibits Debye shielding of the solven‐solvent and solvent‐solute interactions as well as the more familiar solute‐solute shielding.},

	abstract = {We have derived approximate analytic solutions to the master equation describing the evolution of the spin I=3/2 density operator in the presence of a radio-frequency (RF) field and both static and fluctuating quadrupolar interactions. Spectra resulting from Fourier transformation of the evolutions of the on-resonance spin-locked magnetization into the various coherences display two satellite pairs and, in some cases, a central line. The central line is generally trimodal, consisting of a narrow component related to a slowly relaxing mode and two broad components pertaining to two faster relaxing modes. The rates of the fast modes are sensitive to slow molecular motion. Neither the amplitude nor the width of the narrow component is affected by the magnitude of the static coupling, whereas the corresponding features of the broad components depend in a rather complicated manner on the spin-lock field strength and static quadrupolar interaction. Under certain experimental conditions, the dependencies of the amplitudes on the dynamics are seen to vanish and the relaxation rates reduce to relatively simple expressions. One of the promising emerging features is the fact that the evolutions into the selectively detected quadrupolar spin polarization order and the rank-two double-quantum coherence do not exhibit a slowly relaxing mode and are particularly sensitive to slow molecular motion. Furthermore, these coherences can only be excited in the presence of a static coupling and this makes it possible to discern nuclei in anisotropic from those in isotropic environment. The feasibility of the spin-lock pulse sequences with limited RF power and a nonvanishing average electric field gradient has been demonstrated through experiments on sodium in a dense lyotropic DNA liquid crystal.},

For the same water models, we have also calculated the surface tension of a liquid?vapor interface at room temperature. Analogous calculations were carried out for three thermodynamic states of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid near liquid?vapor coexistence. For both water and the LJ fluid at the conditions we have simulated, extrapolation of our results suggests that the planar interface between coexisting liquid and vapor phases has the same surface tension as the planar limit of hard sphere solvation. We expect this correspondence to be a general result for fluids at thermodynamic states close to phase coexistence, as measured by the difference in chemical potential between bulk liquid and vapor phases, and far from the critical point. The solvation free energies we have computed for water and the LJ fluid cross over at microscopic solute sizes from a dependence on solute volume to an approximate dependence on solute surface area, as predicted by Lum et al.

	abstract = {Free energies of pairwise hydrophobic association are simulated in aqueous solutions of urea at concentrations ranging from 0–8 M. Consistent with the expectation that hydrophobic interactions are weakened by urea, the association of relatively large nonpolar solutes is destabilized by urea. However, the association of two small methane-sized nonpolar solutes in water has the opposite tendency of being slightly strengthened by the addition of urea. Such size effects and the dependence of urea-induced stability changes on the configuration of nonpolar solutes are not predicted by solvent accessible surface area approaches based on energetic parameters derived from bulk-phase solubilities of model compounds. Thus, to understand hydrophobic interactions in proteins, it is not sufficient to rely solely on transfer experiment data that effectively characterize a single nonpolar solute in an aqueous environment but not the solvent-mediated interactions among two or more nonpolar solutes. We find that the m-values for the rate of change of two-methane association free energy with respect to urea concentration is a dramatically nonmonotonic function of the spatial separation between the two methanes, with a distance-dependent profile similar to the corresponding two-methane heat capacity of association in pure water. Our results rationalize the persistence of residual hydrophobic contacts in some proteins at high urea concentrations and explain why the heat capacity signature (ΔCP) of a compact denatured state can be similar to ΔCP values calculated by assuming an open random-coil-like unfolded state.

Then, we investigate the influence of confinement on the self-diffusion coefficient (in the direction parallel to the walls) in a fluid slab. We have computed the effect of confinement on the mode-coupling contribution to the diffusion coefficient. These finite-size corrections are shown to reduce the diffusion constant by an amount , where h is the thickness of the fluid slab and the atomic size.

We find that the microscopic structure of the dense liquid plays an important role at intermediate wave vectors. The continuum model description of the dielectric constant, although appropriate at very small values of wave vector, breaks down completely at the intermediate values of k. Numerical results for the longitudinal and the transverse dielectric constants are obtained by using the direct correlation function from the mean‐spherical approximation for dipolar hard spheres.

In our approach, we divide the density of states, assigning half of the configurations found in a simulation to a high-energy partition and half to a low-energy partition. By recursively dividing the low-energy partition into halves, we map out the complete density of states for a continuous system. The result allows free energy to be calculated directly as a function of temperature. We illustrate our method in the context of the free energy of water.},

	abstract = {To escape from a cavity through a small window the particle has to overcome a high entropy barrier to find the exit. As a consequence, its survival probability in the cavity decays as a single exponential and is characterized by the only parameter, the rate constant. We use simulations to study escape of Langevin particles from a cubic cavity through a small round window in the center of one of the cavity walls with the goal of analyzing the friction dependence of the escape rate. We find that the rate constant shows the turnover behavior as a function of the friction constant, ζ: The rate constant grows at very small ζ, reaches a maximum value which is given by the transition-state theory (TST), and then decreases approaching zero as ζ→∞. Based on the results found in simulations and some general arguments we suggest a formula for the rate constant that predicts a turnover of the escape rate for ergodic cavities in which collisions of the particle with the cavity walls are defocusing. At intermediate-to-high friction the formula describes transition between two known results for the rate constant: the TST estimation and the high friction limiting behavior that characterizes escape of diffusing particles. In this range of friction the rate constants predicted by the formula are in good agreement with those found in simulations. At very low friction the rate constants found in simulations are noticeably smaller than those predicted by the formula. This happens because the simulations were run in the cubic cavity which is not ergodic.},

	abstract = {A mechanism for electron transferreactions is described, in which there is very little spatial overlap of the electronic orbitals of the two reacting molecules in the activated complex. Assuming such a mechanism, a quantitative theory of the rates of oxidation‐reduction reactions involving electron transfer in solution is presented. The assumption of ``slight‐overlap\&apos;\&apos; is shown to lead to a reaction path which involves an intermediate state X * in which the electrical polarization of the solvent does not have the usual value appropriate for the given ionic charges (i.e., it does not have an equilibrium value). Using an equation developed elsewhere for the electrostaticfree energy of nonequilibrium states, the free energy of all possible intermediate states is calculated. The characteristics of the most probable state are then determined with the aid of the calculus of variations by minimizing its free energy subject to certain restraints. A simple expression for the electrostatic contribution to the free energy of formation of the intermediate state from the reactants, ΔF *, is thereby obtained in terms of known quantities, such as ionic radii, charges, and the standard free energy of reaction. This intermediate state X * can either disappear to reform the reactants, or by an electronic jump mechanism to form a state X in which the ions are characteristic of the products. When the latter process is more probable than the former, the over‐all reaction rate is shown to be simply the rate of formation of the intermediate state, namely the collision number in solution multiplied by exp(—ΔF */kT). Evidence in favor of this is cited. In a detailed quantitative comparison, given elsewhere, with the kinetic data, no arbitrary parameters are needed to obtain reasonable agreement of calculated and experimental results.},

Experimental evidences for existence of surface silanol and its chemical nature have explored the idea of silica surface modification. Recent methods of development in functionalized silica synthesis by attachment of various ligands or organic reagents to the silica surface and techniques of characterization of the modified surface have been reported. Analytical applications of various modified silica surfaces, in particular, adsorption of trace elements taking separation and preconcentration into account from complex synthetic mixture as well as natural water is presented.},

Our goal was to capture the physical balance between water?s hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in a model that is simple enough to be nearly analytical and not heavily computational. We develop a 2-dimensional Mercedes?Benz-like model of water with which we compute the free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and the heat capacity of transfer as a function of temperature, pressure, and solute size. As validation, we find that this model gives the same trends as Monte Carlo simulations of the underlying 2D model and gives qualitative agreement with experiments. The advantages of this model are that it gives simple insights and that computational time is negligible. It may provide a useful starting point for developing more efficient and more realistic 3D models of aqueous solvation.},

	abstract = {We have implemented a set of Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials for simulation of Fe-Cr alloys. The functions for the pure elements were fitted to the respective elastic constants, vacancy formation energy, and thermal expansion coefficients. For Cr, properties of the paramagnetic state were applied, providing a positive Cauchy pressure and hence applicability of the EAM. By relaxing the requirement of reproducing the pressure–volume relation at short interaction distances, stability of the 〈110〉 self-interstitial could be obtained. Our Fe-potential gives E〈110〉f-E〈111〉f=-0.23eV. Mixed Fe-Cr pair potentials were fitted to the calculated mixing enthalpy of ferromagnetic Fe-Cr, which is negative for Cr concentrations below 6\%. Simulation of thermal aging in Fe-Cr alloys using a potential fitted to the mixing enthalpy of Fe-20Cr exhibited pronounced Cr-precipitation for temperatures below 900 K, in agreement with the phase diagram. No such ordering was observed at any temperature using a potential fitted to the mixing enthalpy of Fe-5Cr. Applied to recoil cascade simulations the new potentials predict a smaller number of surviving defects than potentials found in the literature. We obtain a cascade efficiency of 0.135 NRT for damage energies inbetween 10 and 20 keV. An enhanced probability for Cr atoms to end up in defect structures is observed.},

The melting pressure and temperature are estimated from the coexistence state. For the small system with 1280 atoms, the simulation results show that the melting curve of copper has a good agreement with the experiments and is identical in accuracy with the results of the two-phase coexistence method with 24 000 atoms in the literature.

The use of nanoporous carbon to increase their energy density should not hinder their fast charging. However, the mechanisms for ion transport inside electrified nanopores remain largely unknown. Here we show that the diffusion is characterized by a hierarchy of time scales arising from ion confinement, solvation, and electrosorption effects. By combining electrochemistry experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the in-pore conductivities and diffusion coefficients and their variations with the applied potential. We show that the diffusion of the ions is slower by 1 order of magnitude compared to the bulk electrolyte. The desolvation of the ions occurs on much faster time scales than electrosorption.},

	abstract = {A computational scheme is proposed for ab initio calculations of electronic spectra of molecular systems. The scheme is firmly based on the different effects that determine the excitation energies and properties of the excited states. It aims to be accurate to better than 0.5 eV for excitation energies and should provide structural and physical data for the excited states. Applications are possible to rather large molecules (up to 20 atoms) with high-quality basis sets. Extensions of the approach will be possible when direct methods have been implemented. The scheme is based on the CASSCF method, which gives a proper description of the major features in the electronic structure of the excited state, independent of its complexity, and accounts for all near-degeneracy effects and includes full orbital relaxation. Remaining dynamic electron correlation effects are added using second-order perturbation theory with the CASSCF wavefunction as the reference state. The electronic spectrum of the benzene molecule is used as an illustration. Using a (C, 4s3p2d/H, 3s2p) atomic natural orbital basis set, the following excitation energies are obtained (experimental values in parentheses); 1B2u, 4.70 (4.90); 1B1u, 6.10 (6.20); 1E1u, 7.06 (6.94); 1E2g, 7.77 (7.80) eV. The computed oscillator strength for the 1E1u state is 1.05 as compared to the experimental 1.25. Results of similar accuracy are obtained for the triplet states.},

The deviation from the correct intrinsic linear behavior in finite systems leads to delocalization and localization errors in large and bulk systems. Functionals whose energy is convex for fractional charges such as the local density approximation display an incorrect apparent linearity in the bulk limit, due to the delocalization error. Concave functionals also have an incorrect apparent linearity in the bulk calculation, due to the localization error and imposed symmetry. This resolves an apparent paradox and identifies the physical nature of the error to be addressed to obtain accurate band gaps from density functional theory.},

We have considered the so-called “trapping problem,” in which diffusion takes place exterior to a collection of fixed traps while reaction occurs at their surface. A simulation technique for predicting the overall trapping rate for systems of partially absorbing spherical traps based on the first-passage spheres method is presented. Using data obtained by applying this simulation technique, we then consider the problem of mixtures of partially absorbing traps. By hypothesizing a method for reducing a general mixture of traps to a mixture of perfect absorbers and perfect reflectors (i.e., reducing the dimensionality of the space of variables), we are able to accurately predict the effective surface rate constant and the trapping rate for an arbitrary mixture of partially absorbing traps. Remarkably, we find that a single, nearly universal curve allows accurate predictions to be made over a wide range of trap volume fractions and even for different trap distributions. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A rigorous and generally applicable method for computing solid-liquid coexistence is presented. The method overcomes some of the technical difficulties associated with other solid-liquid simulation procedures and can be implemented within either a molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo framework. The method consists of three steps: First, relative Gibbs free energy curves are created for the solid and liquid phases using histogram reweighting. Next, the free energy difference between the solid and liquid phases is evaluated at a single state point by integrating along a pseudosupercritical transformation path that connects the two phases. Using this result, the solid and liquid free energy curves are referenced to a common point, allowing a single coexistence point to be determined. Finally, Gibbs-Duhem integration is used to determine the full coexistence curve. To evaluate its utility, this method is applied to the Lennard-Jones and NaCl systems. Results for solid-liquid coexistence agree with previous calculations for these systems. In addition, it is shown that the NaCl model does not correctly describe solid-liquid coexistence at high pressures. An analysis of the accuracy of the method indicates that the results are most sensitive to the transformation free energy calculation.© 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {The energy of segregation of Cr from the bulk to the topmost surface layer in dilute Fe-Cr alloys is endothermic but small. On the other hand, the segregation energy from the bulk to the subsurface layer is not only endothermic but relatively large. Thus, the subsurface layer presents a huge barrier, not only for the segregation of Cr from the bulk to the surface, but also for its diffusion from the surface into the bulk. This means that the topmost layer alone cannot be used to determine the barrier for Cr segregation (the segregation energy), which is determined in these alloys by the subsurface layer. We present the results of our ab initio electronic structure calculations on the segregation of Cr as an impurity in Fe, which shed some light on the origin of this anomalous behavior. We find that the interaction of a Cr atom situated in the subsurface layer, in contrast to those in the other layers, is quite complex with its nearest neighbor Fe atoms due to the magnetism of both Fe and Cr, leading to a highly unfavorable electronic structure. This in turn leads to a large endothermic energy of solution of Cr in the subsurface layer. These results are important for a proper understanding of the properties of the technologically important class of Fe-Cr steels with low concentrations of chromium.},

The model systems are pores of diameter varying between 20 and 40 Å containing water at room temperature and at full hydration, prepared using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. Water dynamics in these systems is studied via molecular dynamics simulation. The results of the basic characterization of these systems have been reported in A. A. Milischuk and B. M. Ladanyi [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 174709 (2011)]. The main focus of the present study is the self-intermediate scattering function (ISF), FS(Q, t), of water hydrogens, the observable in quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments. We investigate how FS(Q, t) depends on the pore diameter, the direction and magnitude of the momentum transfer Q, and the proximity of water molecules to the silica surface. We also study the contributions to FS(Q, t) from rotational and translational motions of water molecules and the extent of rotation-translation coupling present in FS(Q, t). We find that FS(Q, t) depends strongly on the pore diameter and that this dependence is due mainly to the contributions to the ISF from water translational motion and can be attributed to the decreased mobility of water molecules near the silica surface. The relaxation rate depends on the direction of Q and is faster for Q in the axial than in the radial direction. As the magnitude of Q increases, this difference diminishes but does not disappear. We find that its source is mainly the anisotropy in translational diffusion at low Q and in molecular reorientation at higher Q values.},

If the thermal ensemble of atomic configurations is mapped (by steepest descent on the potential hypersurface) onto potential energy minima, the pair correlation function from the resulting transformed configurations exhibits substantial image enhancement, revealing short‐range order in a much more vivid fashion. Previous studies of model atomic liquids have demonstrated that at fixed density, mapped short‐range order is virtually independent of the initial temperature, and thereby amounts to an ‘‘inherent structure’’ for the liquid. The present paper investigates steepest‐descent mapping and inherent structure for hard spheres, construed as the infinite‐n limit for pair potentials (a/r)n. Methods used are both analytical and simulational, the latter involving molecular dynamics for n=12 and 24. Results show that inherent structures in the hard‐sphere limit are randomly packed configurations, where particle radii have been inflated to the point of jamming.},

We apply the method to study the transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials for a variety of elements in the Periodic Table. We find that the self-consistent corrections are frequently significant, and should not be neglected. We prove that the partial-core correction improves the pseudopotential hardness of alkaline metals considerably. We propose a quantity to represent the average hardness error and calculate this quantity for many representative elements as a function of pseudopotential cutoff radii. We find that the atomic polarizabilities are usually well reproduced by the norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

However, infrared pump-probe measurements on electrolyte solutions have found that ions have no influence on the rotational dynamics of water molecules, implying no enhancement or breakdown of the hydrogen-bond network. Here, we report optical Kerr effect and dielectric relaxation spectroscopic measurements, which have enabled us to separate the effects of rotational and transitional motions of the water molecules. These data show that electrolyte solutions behave like a supercooled liquid approaching a glass transition in which rotational and translational molecular motions are decoupled. It is now possible to understand previously conflicting viscosity data, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation, and ultrafast infrared spectroscopy in a single unified picture.},

In particular, by combining small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data with neutron spin echo (NSE) and rheology experiments, we are able to identify that an arrest transition takes place at intermediate densities, driven by the slowing down of the cluster motion. Using an effective pair potential among proteins, based on the combination of short-range attraction and long-range repulsion, we account remarkably well for the peculiar volume fraction dependence of the effective structure factor measured by SAXS. We show that a transition from a monomer to a cluster-dominated fluid happens at volume fractions larger than ϕ ≳ 0.05 where the close agreement between NSE measurements and Brownian dynamics simulations confirms the transient nature of the clusters. Clusters even stay transient above the geometric percolation found in simulation at ϕ {\textgreater} 0.15, though NSE reveals a cluster lifetime that becomes increasingly large and indicates a divergence of the diffusivity at ϕ ≃ 0.26. Macroscopic measurements of the viscosity confirm this transition where the long-lived-nature of the clusters is at the origin of the simultaneous dynamical arrest at all length scales.},

The five‐site, methane–methane pair potential is taken from recent work by Spellmeyer and Kollman, while the extended simple point charge model is used to model the water–water interactions. The calculated potentials of mean force at 300 and 330 K indicate that the contact wells are significantly deeper than the corresponding solvent‐separated wells. The effect of the temperature on the calculated potential of mean force is found to be small. The calculated equilibrium constants suggest that the probability of contact and the solvent‐separated pairs are comparable. The shape of our potential of mean force result at room temperature using the extended simple point charge model is very similar to the results of simulations reported by Belle and Wodak using a polarizable water model. It appears that further research is necessary to assess the role of nonadditive effects in modeling of hydrophobic interactions.},

	abstract = {Results of a molecular dynamics simulation of a single polymer chain in a good solvent are presented. The latter is modeled explicitly as a bath of particles. This system provides a first‐principles microscopic test of the hydrodynamic Kirkwood–Zimm theory of the chain’s Brownian motion. A 30 monomer chain is studied in 4066 solvent particles as well as 40/4056 and 60/7940 systems. The density was chosen rather high, in order to come close to the ideal situation of incompressible flow, and to ensure that diffusive momentum transport is much faster than particle motions. In order to cope with the numerical instability of microcanonical algorithms, we generate starting states by a Langevin simulation that includes a coupling to a heat bath, which is switched off for the analysis of the dynamics. The long range of the hydrodynamic interaction induces a large effect of finite box size on the diffusive properties, which is observable for the diffusion constants of both the chain and the solvent particles. The Kirkwood theory of the diffusion constant, as well as the Akcasu et al. theory of the initial decay rate in dynamic light scattering are generalized for the finite box case, replacing the Oseen tensor by the corresponding Ewald sum. In leading order, the finite‐size corrections are inversely proportional to the linear box dimensions. With this modification of the theory taken into account, the Kirkwood formula for the diffusion constant is verified. Moreover, the monomer motions exhibit a scaling that is much closer to Zimm than to Rouse exponents (t2/3 law in the mean square displacement; decay rate of the dynamic structure factor ∝k3). However, the prefactors are not consistent with the theory, indicating that (on the involved short length scales) the dynamics is more complex than the simple hydrodynamic description suggests.},

soft porous crystal) et les z ́eolithes sont actuellement des mat ́eriaux faisant l’objet de tr`es nombreuses

recherches. En effet, leurs nanopores leurs permettent d’avoir une large surface sp ́ecifique ce qui leurs

conf`erent de tr`es bonnes propri ́et ́es d’adsorption. Par cons ́equent, ces mat ́eriaux peuvent avoir des appli-
cations dans le domaine de l’ ́energie avec par exemple le stockage du dihydrog`ene, dans l’environnement

avec la capture de dioxyg`ene ou encore dans le domaine de la sant ́e en servant de vecteur de m ́edicament.

Durant mon stage, je me suis int ́eress ́e plus particumi`erement `a l’adsorption dans les MOF.

Les MOF sont des matrices r ́eguli`eres poreuses constitu ́ees par des centres m ́etalliques et des ligands

organiques. En changeant les ligands et/ou les centres m ́etalliques, on peut obtenir un large pannel de

structures. Les propri ́et ́es d’adsorption des MOF peuvent ˆetre tr`es diff ́erentes selon les ligands et les

centres m ́etalliques. On s’int ́eressera ici plus particuli`erement `a la MOF appel ́ee MIL-53 synth ́etis ́ee `a

qui est le ph ́enom`ene de respiration qui sera d ́etaill ́e ult ́erieurement.

Pour  ́etudier ces mat ́eriaux, les m ́ethodes de simulations uselles sont les simulations de types Monte-
Carlo ou les m ́ethodes de dynamique mol ́eculaire. Ces m ́ethodes sont coˆuteuses en temps de calcul. C’est

pourquoi ces derni`eres ann ́ees des m ́ethodes th ́eoriques, comme la DFT (Density Functional Theory)

classique, se sont d ́evelopp ́ees car elles permettent un gain de temps important. L’ ́etude de l’adsorp-
tion en milieu confin ́e par DFT n’est faite `a l’heure actuelle qu’en 1 ou 2 dimensions. Daniel Borgis et

son  ́equipe ont developp ́e un code de DFT 3D (MDFT) ce qui permet la description de syst`emes plus

r ́ealistes. Jusqu’`a pr ́esent, le code n’a  ́et ́e utilis ́e que pour d ́ecrire des ph ́enom`enes de solvatation. Tout

le travail de mon stage a port ́e sur l’ ́etude de l’adsorption dans un mod`ele r ́ealiste de MOF en utilisant

et en adaptant le code de DFT 3D et en comparant mes r ́esultats avec ceux obtenus par des simulations

Monte-Carlo (travail effectu ́e par David Bousquet dans le cadre de sa th`ese). Ainsi on aura une r ́ef ́erence

pour analyser nos r ́esultats et  ́evaluer l’efficacit ́e de notre m ́ethode.

J’introduirai donc d’abord les  ́el ́ements de physique statistique n ́ecessaire afin d’arriver `a la formula-
tion des diff ́erents th ́eor`emes de DFT classique. Ensuite, l’application de la DFT aux fluides de sph`eres

mon stage. Je pr ́esenterai  ́egalement la structure du code pour montrer comment l’ ́energie est calcul ́ee,

comment la densit ́e est minimis ́ee... Enfin, j’aborderai dans une derni`ere partie l’application de la DFT

`a l’adsorption de particules Lennard-Jones dans des MOF en utilisant un mod`ele simple.},

	abstract = {Doping is generally used to tune and enhance the properties of metal oxides. However, their chemical composition cannot be readily modified beyond low dopant amounts without disrupting the crystalline atomic structure. In the case of anatase TiO2, we introduce a new solution-based chemical route allowing the composition to be significantly modified, substituting the divalent O2? anions by monovalent F? and OH? anions resulting in the formation of cationic Ti4+ vacancies (?) whose concentration can be controlled by the reaction temperature. The resulting polyanionic anatase has the general composition Ti1?x?y?x+yO2?4(x+y)F4x(OH)4y, reaching vacancy concentrations of up to 22\%, i.e., Ti0.78?0.22O1.12F0.4(OH)0.48. Solid-state 19F NMR spectroscopy reveals that fluoride ions can accommodate up to three different environments, depending on Ti and vacancies (i.e. Ti3-F, Ti2?1-F, and Ti1?2-F), with a preferential location close to vacancies. DFT calculations further confirm the fluoride/vacancy ordering. When its characteristics were evaluated as an electrode for reversible Li-ion storage, the material shows a modified lithium reaction mechanism, which has been rationalized by the occurrence of cationic vacancies acting as additional lithium hosting sites within the anatase framework. Finally, the material shows a fast discharging/charging behavior, compared to TiO2, highlighting the benefits of the structural modifications and paving the way for the design of advanced electrode materials, based on a defect mediated mechanism.},

At low values of the wave vector (k), the longitudinal dielectric function ϵ(k) increases with k, in contradiction to some assumptions reported in the literature. As the value of k is increased, ϵ(k) diverges at a critical value kc which depends on the value of the long wavelength static dielectric constant (ϵ0) of the liquid. The dielectric function is negative for values of k greater than kc. At large values of k, the calculated ϵ(k) fails to attain the limiting value of unity. We attribute this result to the failure of the point dipole assumption made in the evaluation of the polarization correlation function required by the theory. The behavior of ϵ(k) for the dipolar liquid is compared with that of one component plasma for which reliable results can be obtained over the full range of wave vectors. For both systems, the stability conditions are fulfilled at all values of k. A plausible explanation of this rather exotic behavior of ϵ(k) is given.},

These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i.e., have a small (down to 0.2 kcal/mol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0.1 D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for linear scaling calculations.},

While osmosis can be expressed in simple terms via the van ’t Hoff ideal gas formula for the osmotic pressure, it is a complex phenomenon taking its roots in the subtle interactions occurring at the scale of the membrane nanopores. Here we use new opportunities offered by nanofluidic systems to create an osmotic diode exhibiting asymmetric water flow under reversal of osmotic driving. We show that a surface charge asymmetry built on a nanochannel surface leads to nonlinear couplings between water flow and the ion dynamics, which are capable of water flow rectification. This phenomenon opens new opportunities for water purification and complex flow control in nanochannels.},

Here, we address the effects of the image charges on the double layer structure and forces. For electrolyte solutions between two neutral plates, we show that depletion of the salt ions by the image charge repulsion results in short-range attractive and long-range repulsive forces. If cations and anions are of different valency, the asymmetric depletion leads to the formation of an induced electrical double layer. In comparison to a 1:1 electrolyte solution, both the attractive and the repulsive parts of the interaction are stronger for the 2:1 electrolyte solution. For two charged plates, the competition between the surface charge and the image charge effect can give rise to like-charge attraction and charge inversion. These results are in stark contrast with predictions from the Poisson-Boltzmann theory.},

Using the efficient structural optimization method based on renormalization techniques and on adjoint differentiation algorithms recently proposed [Sorella, S.; Capriotti, L. J. Chem. Phys.2010, 133, 234111], we present the variational convergence of both wave function parameters and atomic positions. All of the calculations were done using an accurate and compact wave function based on Pauling?s resonating valence bond representation: the Jastrow Antisymmetrized Geminal Power (JAGP). All structural and wave function parameters are optimized, including coefficients and exponents of the Gaussian primitives of the AGP and the Jastrow atomic orbitals. Bond lengths and bond angles are calculated with a statistical error of about 0.1\% and are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The Variational and Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations estimate vertical and adiabatic excitation energies in the ranges 4.623(10)?4.688(5) eV and 3.001(5)?3.091(5) eV, respectively. The adiabatic gap, which is in line with other correlated quantum chemistry methods, is slightly higher than the value estimated by recent photodissociation experiments. Our results demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations have become a promising and computationally affordable tool for the structural optimization of correlated molecular systems.},

Sizable multilayer relaxation is found to extend to the seventh layer from the surface. While low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and first-principles calculations on multilayer relaxations generally agree for low-index surfaces, there is a disagreement for this high-index surface. We conjecture that this disagreement might be due to the small data set and variational freedom in the LEED analysis. The spin magnetic moment of the Fe(310) surface and subsurface atoms is enhanced to 2.85μB and 2.65μB, from a bulk value of 2.23μB. The surface layer enhancement is smaller than that in Fe(100) and larger than that in Fe(111), although all three surfaces have the same coordination number. Subsurface layers are found to play an important role in the magnetization of the surface atoms in the case of an open surface, where the vacuum affects more atomic layers.},

	abstract = {Pulsed field gradient NMR has been applied to study mass transfer, flow, and dispersion in packed chromatographic columns. A single measurement allows the determination of the full displacement probability distribution of all fluid particles located in the measurement volume. Depending on the orientation of the pulsed magnetic field gradient with respect to the net flow direction, the so-called averaged propagator is obtained independently and quantitatively for either the axial or the transverse fluid particle displacements, over an experimentally adjustable observation time. Thus, this technique can act on a dynamic time scale ranging from a few to several hundred milliseconds. This enabled us to detect the stagnant mobile phase in packed chromatographic columns and to follow the mass transfer between the stagnant solvent and the stream of mobile phase percolating through the column bed. With field gradients in the direction of net flow velocity, mean fluid particle displacements ranging between 0.07 and 100 times the average diameter of the stationary phase particles could be analyzed in terms of the intimately associated averaged propagator, with observation times between 30 and 960 ms. Starting in the absence of flow, the development from the Gaussian propagator for molecular diffusion in the packing (centered at zero net displacement) toward the fully established Gaussian propagator (parallel to the onset and increase of externally driven flow) is recorded, characterizing convection-driven dispersion in the packing. For short observation times, the mass transfer between the deep pools of stagnant mobile phase in the totally porous support particles and the interstitial space in the packed bed is found to be incomplete and the transition toward complete exchange is followed. The results indicate that the stagnant mobile-phase mass transfer in the classical HPLC silica-based stationary phase is purely diffusion-controlled.},

	abstract = {Two non-equilibrium methods (called bubble method and splitting method, respectively) have been developed and tested to study the steady state evaporation of a droplet surrounded by its vapor, where the evaporation continuously occurs at the vapor-liquid interface while the droplet size remains constant. In the bubble method, gas molecules are continuously reinserted into a free volume (represented by a bubble) located at the centre of mass of the droplet to keep the droplet size constant. In the splitting method, a molecule close to the centre of mass of the droplet is split into two: In this way, the droplet size is also maintained during the evaporation. By additional local thermostats confined to the area of insertion, the effect of frequent insertions on properties such as density and temperature can be limited to the immediate insertion area. Perturbations are not observed in other parts of the droplet. In the end, both the bubble method and the splitting method achieve steady-state droplet evaporation. Although these methods have been developed using an isolated droplet, we anticipate that they will find a wide range of applications in the study of the evaporation of isolated films and droplets or thin films on heated substrates or under confinement. They can in principle also be used to study the steady-state of other physical processes, such as the diffusion or permeation of gas molecules or ions in a pressure gradient or a concentration gradient.},

We determine the latter from ab initio studies of water clusters and experimental chemical shift measurements. We find that the rotational correlation time for the OD bond vector in D216O varies from 5.8 ps at 275 K to 0.86 ps at 350 K, and that the rotational correlation time for the out-of-plane vector of dilute D217O in D216O varies from 4.4 ps at 275 K to 0.64 ps at 350 K.

	abstract = {A new multiconfigurational quantum chemical method, SplitGAS, is presented. The configuration interaction expansion, generated from a generalized active space, GAS, wave function is split in two parts, a principal part containing the most relevant configurations and an extended part containing less relevant, but not negligible, configurations. The partition is based on an orbital criterion. The SplitGAS method has been employed to study the HF, N2, and Cr2 molecules. The results on these systems, especially on the challenging, multiconfigurational Cr2 molecule, are satisfactory. While SplitGAS is comparable with the GASSCF method in terms of memory requirements, it performs better than the complete active space method followed by second-order perturbation theory, CASPT2, in terms of equilibrium bond length, dissociation energy, and vibrational properties.},

Because the dynamic effects on the TOF data have a very different dependence on momentum transfer (Q) from those for the reactor data, the two sets of data offer a unique opportunity to establish an estimate of the magnitude of the dynamic correction. Apart from a discrepancy at small Q which is not fully understood at present, the different diffraction techniques show good agreement over most of the Q range. The comparison is used to discuss the applicability of the H/D subtraction (which involves no arbitrary fitting parameters) to molecular liquids in general: the main features in the structure factors can be determined readily. On the other hand, it is likely that finer details such as quantum effects will be obscured by experimental imitations.},

The response depends upon the response at all k values, the low k behavior corresponding to continuum (universal) macroscopic dielectric effects, and the high k behavior corresponding to molecular (specific) phenomena which may have to be treated by quantum mechanics. We have focused on the quasicontinuum limits for which the low k behavior is assumed, but the sizes of ions and dipoles, and the velocities of ions are incorporated. We also look at some general properties of high k behavior; for example, because the polarization energy for small ions is independent of ion size, it is usually thought that solventbergs form about the ions, but, at least in part, this phenomenon can be explained by geometric considerations.},

The local structures of molten ACl have been studied via the analysis of Radial Distribution Functions and Angular Distribution Functions. Coordination number of A-Cl decreases when ACl melts from solid and increases as cationic radius increases. Molten LiCl takes a distorted tetrahedral complex as micro configuration, while other melts have the tendency to keep the original local structure of corresponding crystal. Temperature has no significant effect on the local structures of molten ACls. The results also show that the Tosi-Fumi potential predicts positive temperature dependences for self-diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivity, and negative temperature dependences for both viscosity and thermal conductivity of molten ACls. Ionic diffusivity decreases as cationic radius increases from LiCl to CsCl. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental data available in the literature.},

The relationship between the conductivity and viscosity passes from that expected for independently diffusing ions in the dilute mixtures to strongly decoupled Li+ migration through a viscous network at higher concentrations. The transition between these régimes is linked to the changing local and intermediate-scale structure in the melts. The decoupling phenomenon is associated with the appearance of migration channels in the network which leads to cooperative effects in the Li+ migration.},

The simulations clearly show the algebraic t-D/2 tail of the VACF. We compare the observed long-time tail with the predictions of mode-coupling theory. In three dimensions, the amplitude of this tail is found to agree within the (small) statistical error with these predictions. In two dimensions small but significant deviations from mode-coupling theory of up to 5\% are observed.},

The use of nanoporous carbon to increase their energy density should not hinder their fast charging. However, the mechanisms for ion transport inside electrified nanopores remain largely unknown. Here we show that the diffusion is characterized by a hierarchy of time scales arising from ion confinement, solvation, and electrosorption effects. By combining electrochemistry experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the in-pore conductivities and diffusion coefficients and their variations with the applied potential. We show that the diffusion of the ions is slower by 1 order of magnitude compared to the bulk electrolyte. The desolvation of the ions occurs on much faster time scales than electrosorption.},

The calculation of these thermodynamic quantitites was limited in the past by their slow convergence relative to the free energy. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the energy, entropy, and free energy of solvation of NMA and CH3NH2, as well as their relative values, have been determined. Three different methods (the thermodynamic perturbation method, the thermodynamic integration method, and a finite-difference method) are compared. The finite difference method gives the best results and accurate values for the entropy and energy were obtained using a reasonable amount to computer time. The results suggest that a meaningful thermodynamic description of biomolecular processes can be realized with present methods and the available computer time. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

We describe a robust Monte Carlo simulation method for calculating phase coexistence in multicomponent mixtures. We use this approach to study the phase behavior of lattice models of multicomponent mixtures with strongly varying pair interactions. Such a system can be thought of as a simplified model of the cytosol, with both specific and nonspecific interactions. We show that mapping a multicomponent mixture onto an approximately equivalent one-component system yields both upper and lower bounds on the maximum solute volume fraction of a stable, homogeneous phase. By following the minimum excess-free-energy path from the dilute phase free-energy minimum, we predict the difference in composition between the condensed and dilute phases at the boundary of the homogeneous phase. We find that this “direction” of phase separation rarely aligns with the dominant direction of density fluctuations in the dilute phase. We also show that demixing transitions tend to lower the maximum solute volume fraction at which the homogeneous phase is stable. By considering statistical ensembles of mixtures with random interactions, we show that the demixing contribution to phase separation is self-averaging and dependent only on the mean and variance of the distribution of interactions.},

The results demonstrate the importance of multilayer relaxation mechanisms, and the sensitivity of the results to the model of the surface electronic density.

	abstract = {Biopreservation by saccharides is a widely studied issue due to its scientific and technological importance; in particular, ternary amorphous protein-saccharide-water systems are extensively exploited to model the characteristics of the in vivo biopreservation process. We present here a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study on amorphous trehalose-water systems with embedded different proteins (myoglobin, lysozyme, BSA, hemoglobin), which differ for charge, surface, and volume properties. In our study, the protein/trehalose molar ratio is kept constant at 1/40, while the water/sugar molar ratio is varied between 2 and 300; results are compared with those obtained for binary trehalose-water systems. DSC upscans offer the possibility of investigating, in the same measurement, the thermodynamic properties of the matrix (glass transition, T(g)) and the functional properties of the encapsulated protein (thermal denaturation, T(den)). At high-to-intermediate hydration, the presence of the proteins increases the glass transition temperature of the encapsulating matrix. The effect mainly depends on size properties, and it can be ascribed to confinement exerted by the protein on the trehalose-water solvent. Conversely, at low hydration, lower T(g) values are measured in the presence of proteins: the lack of water promotes sugar-protein interactions, thus weakening the confinement effect and softening the matrix with respect to the binary system. A parallel T(den) increase is also observed; remarkably, this stabilization can reach ∼70 K at low hydration, a finding potentially of high biotechnological relevance. A linear relationship between T(g) and T(den) is also observed, in line with previous results; this finding suggests that collective water-trehalose interactions, responsible for the glass transition, also influence the protein denaturation.},

The Modified Quasichemical Model in the Quadruplet Approximation for short-range ordering was used for the molten salt phase. The thermodynamic database developed is a first step towards a quantitative study of the beryllium mass balance in an electrolysis cell. In particular, the predominant Be-containing species in the gas phase evolved at the anode were identified; and, for a given beryllium content of the alumina, the beryllium content of the electrolytic bath at steady state was assessed under several approximations.},

	abstract = {The use of Ewald and related methods to handle electrostatic interactions in explicit-solvent simulations of solutions imposes an artificial periodicity on systems which are inherently nonperiodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of those computer simulations. In the present study, we propose a general method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts. As a first example, this scheme is applied to the solvation free-energy of a spherical ion. It is found that artificial periodicity reduces the magnitude of the ionic solvation free-energy, because the solvent in the periodic copies of the central unit cell is perturbed by the periodic copies of the ion, thus less available to solvate the central ion. In the limit of zero ionic radius and infinite solventpermittivity, this undersolvation can be corrected by adding the Wigner self-energy term to the solvation free-energy. For ions of a finite size or a solvent of finite permittivity, a further correction is needed. An analytical expression for this correction is derived using continuum electrostatics. As a second example, the effect of artificial periodicity on the potential of mean force for the interaction between two spherical ions is investigated. It is found that artificial periodicity results in an attractive force between ions of like charges, and a repulsive force between ions of opposite charges. The analysis of these two simple test cases reveals that two individually large terms, the periodicity-induced perturbations of the Coulomb and solvation contributions, often cancel each other significantly, resulting in an overall small perturbation. Three factors may prevent this cancellation to occur and enhance the magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectricpermittivity, (ii) a solute cavity of non-negligible size compared to the unit cell size, and (iii) a solute bearing a large overall charge.},

The resulting diffusion equation is solved numerically with the alternating-direction fully implicit method under Neumann boundary conditions. Two types of pore structure symmetries are considered, hexagonal and cubic. The former is modeled as parallel channels while in case of the latter equal-sized channels are placed perpendicularly thus creating an interconnected network. First, general features of transport in both systems are explored, followed by the analysis of the impact of molecular properties on diffusion inside and out of the porous matrix. The influence of pore size on the diffusion-controlled release kinetics is assessed and the findings used to comment recent experimental studies of drug release profiles from ordered mesoporous silicates.},

We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system.

A fluorine treatment, with NH4F or HF, on the TiO2 electrodes leads to a general increase of QDSCs performance in a range of QDSCs using different light absorbing materials: CdS, CdSe, and PbS/CdS. In contrast, no significant effect on QDSC performance has been observed after a TiCl4 treatment conventionally used for high performance dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Surface and photoelectrochemical characterization of treated electrodes and full solar cells was carried out by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), impedance spectroscopy (IS), and applied bias voltage decay (ABVD), to understand the origin of the beneficial effect of fluorine. It was found that the origin of the enhancement is different depending on the semiconductor material (CdS, CdSe, and PbS/CdS). For CdS and CdSe, the recombination of photoinjected carrier is reduced after F treatment. On the other hand, for PbS/CdS, the treatment accelerates the deposition kinetics of PbS by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), increasing the amount of deposited material and consequently the light harvesting. Our study indicates, in general, that treatments different from those conventionally used in DSCs are required and, specifically, that F treatment can be systematically used in QDSCs to increase the solar cell performance.},

In particular, the nanochannel enhances the difference between cationic and anionic NPs during the translocation process. With the increase of salt concentration, the ion flux increases nonlinearly with external field strength, in agreement with recent experimental observations, while the NP flux decreases, which suggests a nontrivial competition between the translocation of ions and NPs. Our results revealed the important role of ions during the NP translocation and may have implications in the detection, separation, and filtration of charged NPs.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of attractive interactions between spherical crowders and protein residues on the thermodynamics and structure of two weakly binding protein complexes: ubiquitin/UIM1 and cytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase. Systematic replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) simulations are performed over a range of attraction strengths and crowder packing fractions using a transferable coarse-grained protein binding model. We find that moderate attractive interactions (≈0.2 kcal/mol) between crowders and protein residues can destabilize protein association, and therefore counteract the stabilizing effect of excluded volume interactions. The destabilization of protein binding, as measured by an increase in binding free energy, increases with increasing crowder packing fraction. For a critical attraction strength value, which is found to be approximately independent of crowder packing fraction, the destabilization due to attractions is exactly canceled by the stabilization effect of excluded volume interactions. This results in a net zero change in binding free energy with respect to a crowder-free solution. Further, we find that attractive interactions between crowders and protein residues can favor transiently bound encounter complexes over the native specific complexes in the bound state. We propose a simple theoretical model based on the scaled particle theory augmented by a mean-field attraction term that can explain our simulation results semiquantitatively.},

Using the efficient structural optimization method based on renormalization techniques and on adjoint differentiation algorithms recently proposed [Sorella, S.; Capriotti, L. J. Chem. Phys.2010, 133, 234111], we present the variational convergence of both wave function parameters and atomic positions. All of the calculations were done using an accurate and compact wave function based on Pauling?s resonating valence bond representation: the Jastrow Antisymmetrized Geminal Power (JAGP). All structural and wave function parameters are optimized, including coefficients and exponents of the Gaussian primitives of the AGP and the Jastrow atomic orbitals. Bond lengths and bond angles are calculated with a statistical error of about 0.1\% and are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The Variational and Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations estimate vertical and adiabatic excitation energies in the ranges 4.623(10)?4.688(5) eV and 3.001(5)?3.091(5) eV, respectively. The adiabatic gap, which is in line with other correlated quantum chemistry methods, is slightly higher than the value estimated by recent photodissociation experiments. Our results demonstrate how Quantum Monte Carlo calculations have become a promising and computationally affordable tool for the structural optimization of correlated molecular systems.},

	abstract = {We report a method to dramatically improve the accuracy of hydration free energies (HFE) calculated by the 1D and 3D reference interaction site models (RISM) of molecular integral equation theory. It is shown that the errors in HFEs calculated by RISM approaches using the Gaussian fluctuations (GF) free energy functional are not random, but can be decomposed into linear combination of contributions from different structural elements of molecules (number of double bonds, number of OH groups, etc.). Therefore, by combining RISM/GF with cheminformatics, one can develop an accurate method for HFE prediction. We call this approach the structural description correction model (SDC) ( Ratkova et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2010 , 114 , 12068 ). In this work, we investigated the prediction quality of the SDC model combined with 1D and 3D RISM approaches. In parallel, we analyzed the computational performance of these two methods. The SDC model parameters were obtained by fitting against a training set of 53 simple organic molecules. To demonstrate that the values of these parameters were transferable between different classes of molecules, the models were tested against 98 more complex molecules (including 38 polyfragment compounds). The results show that the 3D RISM/SDC model predicts the HFEs with very good accuracy (RMSE of 0.47 kcal/mol), while the 1D RISM approach provides only moderate accuracy (RMSE of 1.96 kcal/mol). However, a single 1D RISM/SDC calculation takes only a few seconds on a PC, whereas a single 3D RISM/SDC HFE calculation is approximately 100 times more computationally expensive. Therefore, we suggest that one should use the 1D RISM/SDC model for large-scale high-throughput screening of molecular hydration properties, while further refinement of these properties for selected compounds should be carried out with the more computationally expensive but more accurate 3D RISM/SDC model.},

We present Monte Carlo simulations of the binary Fe-Cr alloy based on the cluster expansion approximation for the enthalpy of the system. The set of cluster expansion coefficients is validated against density functional calculations of energies of small clusters of chromium in bcc structure. We show that in the limit of small Cr concentration the enthalpy of mixing remains negative up to fairly high temperatures, and individual Cr atoms remain well separated from each other. Clustering of Cr atoms begins at concentrations exceeding approximately 10\% at 800 K and 20\% at 1400 K, with Cr-Fe interfaces being parallel to the [110] planes. Calculations show that the first and the second short-range order parameters change sign at approximately 10.5\% Cr, in agreement with experimental observations. Semi-grand-canonical ensemble simulations used together with experimental data on vibrational entropy of mixing give an estimate for the temperature of the top of the α-α′ miscibility gap. We find that the complex ordering reactions occurring in Fe-Cr, as well as the thermodynamic properties of the alloy, can be reasonably well described using a few concentration-independent cluster expansion coefficients.},

We suggest a theoretical formalism which accounts for coupling by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the solvent with respect to a solvent volume exclusion function. The resulting differential equation is similar to the Laplace-Young equation for the geometrical description of capillary interfaces but is extended to microscopic scales by explicitly considering curvature corrections as well as dispersion and electrostatic contributions. Unlike existing implicit solvent approaches, the solvent accessible surface is an output of our model. The presented formalism is illustrated on spherically or cylindrically symmetrical systems of neutral or charged solutes on different length scales. The results are in agreement with computer simulations and, most importantly, demonstrate that our method captures the strong sensitivity of solvent expulsion and dewetting to the particular form of the solvent-solute interactions.},

As a paradigm the friction coefficient is found to vanish below a threshold diameter for armchair nanotubes. Using a statistical description of the interfacial friction, we highlight here a structural origin of this curvature dependence, mainly associated with a curvature-induced incommensurability between the water and carbon structures.

The measured adiabatic detachment energies, which are sensitive to the terminal ligand substitution, provide the intrinsic oxidation potentials of the [Fe4S4L4]2- complexes.

	abstract = {The diffusion of He in irradiated α-Fe is studied using a rate theory model addressing the effect of impurities. Ab initio values for the migration and binding energies of He, He-vacancy complexes, vacancy, and self-interstitial clusters are used to model desorption experiments of He-implanted α-Fe. Using the brute ab initio data yields a significant discrepancy with experimental measurements. On the other hand, good agreement is obtained when the vacancy migration energy is increased from the original ab initio value while the binding energies of vacancies with substitutional and interstitial helium are lowered. The presence of impurities, with carbon being the most likely candidate, is proposed as a justification for these effective energies. Our simulations also provide a detailed description of the diffusion mechanisms of He active under these particular experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

We verify our simulation scheme by means of a Chapman-Enskog expansion. Our method is applied to the calculation of the reduced sedimentation velocity U/U0 for a cubic array of charged spheres in an electrolyte. We show that we recover the analytical solution first derived by Booth [F. Booth, J. Chem. Phys. 22, 1956 (1954)] for a weakly charged, isolated sphere in an unbounded electrolyte. The present method makes it possible to go beyond the Booth theory, and we discuss the dependence of the sedimentation velocity on the charge of the spheres.

	abstract = {In this work, we generalize the recently proposed matrix product state perturbation theory (MPSPT) for calculating energies of excited states using quasi-degenerate (QD)perturbation theory. Our formulation uses the Kirtman-Certain-Hirschfelder canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory, which gives Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each order, and also allows one to make use of Wigner’s 2n + 1 rule. Further, our formulation satisfies Granovsky’s requirement of model space invariance which is important for obtaining smooth potential energy curves. Thus, when we use MPSPT with the Dyall Hamiltonian, we obtain a model space invariant version of quasi-degenerate n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT), a property that the usual formulation of QD-NEVPT2 based on a multipartitioning technique lacked. We use our method on the benchmark problems of bond breaking of LiF which shows ionic to covalent curve crossing and the twist around the double bond of ethylene where significant valence-Rydberg mixing occurs in the excited states. In accordance with our previous work, we find that multi-reference linearized coupled clustertheory is more accurate than other multi-reference theories of similar cost.},

The resulting equation can be studied in two different physical limits: diffusive dynamics, typical of colloidal fluids without hydrodynamic interaction where particles are subject to overdamped motion resulting from coupling with a solvent at rest, and inertial dynamics, typical of molecular fluids. Finally, we propose an algorithm to solve numerically and efficiently the resulting kinetic equation by employing a discretization procedure analogous to the one used in the lattice Boltzmann method.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

The observation of the critical point strengthens the possibility that the extended simple point charge model of water may undergo a liquid-liquid phase transition. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the approach to the liquid-liquid critical point could be pre-empted by the glass transition.},

The results are used to test the accuracy of Brownian motion assumptions which are basic to hydrodynamic models of ion dynamics in solution. The self‐diffusion coefficient of the Na+ ion predicted by Brownian motion theory is (0.65±0.1)×10−5cm2/s. This value is about 60\% greater than the one obtained for the proper dynamics of the finite mass ion, (0.4±0.1)×10−5cm2/s. The numerically correct velocity autocorrelation function is nonexponential, and the autocorrelation of the force on the stationary ion does not decay faster than the ion velocity autocorrelation function. Motivated by previous hydrodynamic modeling of friction kernels, we examine the approximation in which the memory function for the velocity autocorrelation function is identified with the autocorrelation function of the force on the stationary ion. The overall agreement between this approximation for the velocity autocorrelation function and the numerically correct answer is quite good.},

We show that the friction coefficient exhibits a strong curvature dependence; while friction is independent of confinement for the graphene slab, it decreases with carbon nanotube radius for water inside, but increases for water outside. As a paradigm the friction coefficient is found to vanish below a threshold diameter for armchair nanotubes. Using a statistical description of the interfacial friction, we highlight here a structural origin of this curvature dependence, mainly associated with a curvature-induced incommensurability between the water and carbon structures. These results support the recent experiments reporting fast transport of water in nanometric carbon nanotube membranes.},

Two approximations for the exchange-correlation term were employed: namely, the local (spin) density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation. Computed values of equilibrium lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and magnetic moments were compared with available experimental data. The stability of the ground-state structure in the tensile region was assessed via comparison of its total energy and enthalpy with those of some other structures. No instabilities were found before reaching the inflection point on the total energy versus volume curve and the stress related to this point was therefore considered to be the ideal strength.},

	abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

	abstract = {Direct correlation functions (DCFs) play a pivotal role in the applications of classical density functional theory (DFT) to addressing the thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous systems beyond the local-density or mean-field approximations. Whereas numerous studies have been dedicated to the radial distribution functions of liquid water – the most important solvent on earth, relatively little attention has been given to the site-site DCFs. The water DCFs are long-ranged and difficult to calculate directly by simulation, and the predictions from conventional liquid-state theories have been rarely calibrated. Here we report a computational procedure for accurate evaluation of the site-site DCFs of liquid water based on three popular molecular models (viz., SPC, SPC/E, and TIP3P). The numerical results provide a benchmark for calibration of conventional liquid-state theories and fresh insights into development of new DFT methods. We show that: (1) the long-range behavior of the site-site DCFs depends on both the molecular model and the thermodynamic condition; (2) the asymptotic limit of DCFs at large distance does not follow the mean-spherical approximation (MSA); (3) individual site-site DCFs are long ranged (∼40 nm) but a summation of all DCF pairs exhibits only short-range behavior (∼1 nm or a few water diameters); (4) the site-site bridge correlation functions behave as the DCFs, i.e., they are also long-ranged while the summation of all bridge correlation functions is short ranged. Our analytical and numerical analyses of the DCFs provide some simple strategies for possible improvement of the numerical performance of conventional liquid-state theories.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the RISM integral equation for site–site pair correlation functions previously proposed by us is discussed and applied to model liquids composed of strongly polar diatomic molecules. The nonuniform molecular charge distribution is represented by the introduction of charged interaction sites. The generalization consists of applying closure conditions analogous to those which are known to be reasonable for the description of atomic ionic fluids, and the corresponding renormalization of the contributions arising from long range forces. We discuss both the symmetry properties of the pair correlation functions in special cases and the dielectric properties implied by theory. Applications are presented for three two‐site models which differ substantially in the degree of asymmetry of the non‐Coulombic potential between the two sites, and for three three‐site models for Br2. The two sites models are compared to computer simulation results, and those for Br2 to experimental results. The analysis shows that the integral equation is well balanced in that in every case the qualitative features of the liquids structure which are introduced by polarity are well represented, even in cases where the site–site potentials are individually much larger than kBT. In cases where the molecular shape and polar forces are in competition, the results are of comparable accuracy to the corresponding theory for nonpolar systems. In the extreme case where changes in orientational structure can occur without interfering with packing requirements, the results appear quantitatively less reliable.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that the capacitance of subnanometer pores increases anomalously as the pore width decreases, thereby opening a new avenue for developing supercapacitors with enhanced energy density. However, this behavior is still subject to some controversy since its physical origins are not well understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that the capacitance of slit-shaped nanopores in contact with room-temperature ionic liquids exhibits a U-shaped scaling behavior in pores with widths from 0.75 to 1.26 nm. The left branch of the capacitance scaling curve directly corresponds to the anomalous capacitance increase and thus reproduces the experimental observations. The right branch of the curve indirectly agrees with experimental findings that so far have received little attention. The overall U-shaped scaling behavior provides insights on the origins of the difficulty in experimentally observing the pore-width-dependent capacitance. We establish a theoretical framework for understanding the capacitance of electrical double layers in nanopores and provide mechanistic details into the origins of the observed scaling behavior. The framework highlights the critical role of ?ion solvation? in controlling pore capacitance and the importance of choosing anion/cation couples carefully for optimal energy storage in a given pore system.},

	abstract = {The integral equations for the correlation functions of an inhomogeneous fluid mixture are derived using a functional Taylor expansion of the free energy around an inhomogeneous equilibrium distribution. The system of equations is closed by the introduction of a reference functional for the correlations beyond second order in the density difference from the equilibrium distribution. Explicit expressions are obtained for energies required to insert particles of the fluid mixture into the inhomogeneous system. The approach is illustrated by the determination of the equation of state of a simple, truncated Lennard-Jones fluid and the analysis of the behaviour of this fluid near a hard wall. The wall–fluid integral equation exhibits complete drying and the corresponding coexisting densities are in good agreement with those obtained from the standard (Maxwell) construction applied to the bulk fluid. The self-consistency of the approach is examined by analysing the virial/compressibility routes to the equation of state and the Gibbs–Duhem relation for the bulk fluid, and the contact density sum rule and the Gibbs adsorption equation for the hard-wall problem. For the bulk fluid, we find good self-consistency for stable states outside the critical region. For the hard-wall problem, the Gibbs adsorption equation is fulfilled very well near phase coexistence where the adsorption is large. For the contact density sum rule, we find deviations of up to 20\% in the ratio of the contact densities predicted by the present method and predicted by the sum rule. These deviations are largely due to a slight disagreement between the coexisting density for the gas phase obtained from the Maxwell construction and from complete drying at the hard wall.},

The experimental difficulties that plague this thermodynamic region have somewhat obscured the interpretations of the results. Consequently, the coupling of long-range critical fluctuations with short-range intermolecular interactions is still a matter of debate. We developed a new strategy consisting of studying the changes in the solvation shell of probe molecules dissolved in a binary solvent mixture close to its lower consolute critical point. The study is based on UV-vis absorption and fluorescent emission measurements of the solvatochromic and thermochromic effects of two dyes, Reichardt's Dye and Nile Red, dissolved in mixtures of lutidine-water. The results show unambiguously the existence of a subtle change in the composition of the near-critical solvent surrounding the probe molecules with respect to the bulk composition, thus we conclude that the coupling of long-range fluctuations with short-range interactions is now firmly established.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schrödinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods—a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O 2 , CH 4 , and NaH—with FCI spaces ranging from 10 9 to 10 14 , whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

	abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

	abstract = {Maxwell?s equations, which treat electromagnetic interactions between macroscopic charged objects in materials, have explained many phenomena and contributed to many applications in our lives. Derived in 1861 when no methods were available to determine the atomic structure of macromolecules, Maxwell?s equations assume the solvent to be a structureless continuum. However, near-solute solvent molecules are highly structured, unlike far-solute bulk solvent molecules. Current methods cannot treat both the near-solute solvent structure and time-dependent electromagnetic interactions in a macroscopic system. Here, we derive ?microscopic? electrodynamics equations that can treat macroscopic time-dependent electromagnetic field problems like Maxwell?s equations and reproduce the solvent molecular and dipole density distributions observed in molecular dynamics simulations. These equations greatly reduce computational expense by not having to include explicit solvent molecules, yet they treat the solvent electrostatic and van der Waals effects more accurately than continuum models. They provide a foundation to study electromagnetic interactions between molecules in a macroscopic system that are ubiquitous in biology, bioelectromagnetism, and nanotechnology. The general strategy presented herein to incorporate the near-solute solvent structure would enable studies on how complex cellular protein?ligand interactions are affected by electromagnetic radiation, which could help to prevent harmful electromagnetic spectra or find potential therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {In a reference frame rigidly bound to the complex, we consider two Hamiltonians possibly at the origin of the very fast electronic relaxation of the paramagnetic lanthanide Ln3+ ions (Ln = Ce to Nd, Tb to Yb), namely the mean (static) ligand-field Hamiltonian and the transient ligand-field Hamiltonian. In the laboratory frame, the bombardment of the complex by solvent molecules causes its Brownian rotation and its vibration-distorsion dynamics governing the fluctuations of the static and transient terms, respectively. These fluctuations are at the origin of electronic relaxation. The electronic relaxation of a Ln3+ ion is defined by the decays of the time correlation functions (TCFs) of the longitudinal and transverse components of the total angular momentum J of its ground multiplet. The Brownian rotation of the complex and its vibration-distorsion dynamics are simulated by random walks, which enable us to compute the TCFs from first principles. It is shown that the electronic relaxation is governed mainly by the magnitude of the transient ligand-field, and not by its particular expression. The range of expected values of this ligand-field together with the lower limit of relaxation time enforced by the values of the vibration-distortion correlation time in liquids give rise to effective electronic relaxation times which are in satisfactory overall agreement with the experimental data. In particular, these considerations explain why the electronic relaxation times vary little with the coordinating ligand and are practically independent of the external field magnitude.},

By the method of Legendre transforms, one demonstrates the existence of a free energy density functional where the densities refer to the locations of interaction sites (not full molecular coordinates). A variational principle for the free energy is derived. The methodology retains nearly all the mathematical simplicity of the traditional theory of atomic fluids. Thus, it may provide a practical route to deriving mean field theories of assembly and phase transitions in complex systems. Certain nonlinearities intrinsic to polyatomic systems and absent in simple fluids become apparent in our analysis. These features are associated with the entropy density functional for systems with bonding constraints. They must be carefully assessed in accurate applications.},

the spinodal process of decomposition during aging. When the alloy lies inside of the miscibility gap but outside of the spinodal,
a pramagnetic precipitate clearly appears right from the beginning of the aging process, while when the alloy lies inside
of the spinodal, no paramagnetic phase appears even after 1050 hr of aging at 470°C. This certainly indicates that the spinodal
decomposition is very slow. One more point is shown: aging outside of the miscibility gap shows clearly a clustering of the
chromium atoms and a large departure from the concept of an ideal solid solution.},

The solvent is modeled by dipolar hard spheres, while the monovalent ions are oppositely charged hard spheres; cohesion is ensured by a Yukawa attraction between all three species. The free energy functional describing the inhomogeneous solution includes the best available fundamental measure description of excluded volume correlations in a ternary mixture of hard spheres, whereas all electrostatic and cohesive interactions are treated within the mean-field approximation. We find both first and second order wetting transitions which are rather little affected by ions at low and moderate concentrations, compared to the wetting behavior of the pure solvent. A novel drying scenario is predicted, where complete drying is prevented by the electrostatic attraction between a positively charged substrate and the anions, while near a negatively charged substrate, a first order transition with a predrying line is observed. The various scenarios are surprisingly similar to our previous predictions based on a “semiprimitive” model where the solvent particles carry no dipole, but the ion-ion interactions are reduced by a local dielectric permittivity.},

A semiquantitative interpretation of the intrinsic quadrupolar and dipolar relaxation behavior is performed by a multiscale modeling of the Li+ ions? diffusion in relation to the structure of the clay dispersions.

Outlining the origin, nature, and properties of particles in water, the author covers particle size, transport processes, and light scattering and provides a broad outline of important techniques for particle size determination. He discusses the important topic of surface charge, which plays a major role in colloid stability and interactions between particles, with some emphasis on the role of dissolved salts. The book gives an account of particle aggregation kinetics, the form of aggregates, and aggregate strength and explores coagulation and flocculation and the modes of action of some common additives used in these processes. The book concludes with an overview of important solid-liquid separation processes and the principles on which they are based. The author presents the material in an easily accessible style, using just enough math to be clear but not so much as to be overwhelming. Highlighting the growing importance of advanced filtration systems in water treatment, this book provides an excellent summary of the behavior of particles in water systems and in relation to the techniques designed to capture and remove them.},

The method is based on a combination of the reference interaction site model (RISM) with several empirical corrections. The model requires only a small number of chemical descriptors associated with the main features of the chemical structure of solutes: excluded volume, branch, double bond, benzene ring, hydroxyl group, halogen atom, aldehyde group, ketone group, ether group, and phenol fragment. The optimum model was selected after testing of different RISM free energy expressions on a training set of 65 molecules. We show that the correction parameters of the SDC model are transferable between different chemical classes, which allows one to cover a wide range of organic solutes. The new model substantially increases the accuracy of calculated HFEs by RISM giving the standard deviation of the error for a test set of 120 organic molecules around 1.2 kcal/mol.},

The hydration structures of the different carbonate species depend on their ability to accept and donate H-bonds with H(2)O. The H-bonds donated by the C-O-H sites of the carbonate species to water molecules are generally stronger and longer-lived than those accepted by these sites from water molecules. The structural relaxation among the water molecules is dominated by diffusional (translational) motion of H(2)O, whereas the H-bond reorganization is dominated by the librational motion of the water molecules and the carbonate species. The rates of structural relaxation of the H(2)O molecules and the rates of H-bond reorganization among them are slower in systems containing carbonate species, consistent with previous studies of simple salt solutions. The strengths and lifetimes of H-bonds involving the carbonate species positively correlate with the total negative charge on the species. H-bond donation from H(2)O to CO(2) is weak, but the presence of CO(2) noticeably affects the structure and structural relaxation of the surrounding H-bonding network leading to generally stronger H-bonds and slower relaxation rates, the behavior typical of a hydrophobic solute.},

	abstract = {We describe a new way to calculate the electrostatic properties of macromolecules that goes beyond the classical Poisson-Boltzmann treatment with only a small extra CPU cost. The solvent region is no longer modeled as a homogeneous dielectric media but rather as an assembly of self-orienting interacting dipoles of variable density. The method effectively unifies both the Poisson-centric view and the Langevin Dipole model. The model results in a variable dielectric constant ε ( r → ) in the solvent region and also in a variable solvent density ρ ( r → ) that depends on the nature of the closest exposed solute atoms. The model was calibrated using small molecules and ions solvation data with only two adjustable parameters, namely the size and dipolar moment of the solvent. Hydrophobicity scales derived from the solvent density profiles agree very well with independently derived hydrophobicity scales, both at the atomic or residue level. Dimerization interfaces in homodimeric proteins or lipid-binding regions in membrane proteins clearly appear as poorly solvated patches on the solute accessible surface. Comparison of the thermally averaged solvent density of this model with the one derived from molecular dynamics simulations shows qualitative agreement on a coarse-grained level. Because this calculation is much more rapid than that from molecular dynamics, applications of a density-profile-based solvation energy to the identification of the true structure among a set of decoys become computationally feasible. Various possible improvements of the model are discussed, as well as extensions of the formalism to treat mixtures of dipolar solvents of different sizes.},

We explain this effect by image forces which exponentially screen out the electrostatic interactions of ions in the interior of a pore. Packing of ions of the same sign becomes easier and is mainly limited by steric interactions. We call this state 'superionic' and suggest a simple model to describe it. The model reveals the possibility of a voltage-induced first order transition between a cation(anion)-deficient phase and a cation(anion)-rich phase which manifests itself in a jump of capacitance as a function of voltage.},

The expressions apply not only to molecules with permanent multipoles, but also to systems of polarizable ions where the multipoles are induced by the interionic interactions.

In the simulations, a water adsorption layer or water menisci were formed in a mesopore accompanying the growth or shrinkage of stable adsorption layers on the upper and lower surfaces. The thickness of a water adsorption layer immediately before the onset of capillary condensation and the curvature radius of a water meniscus prior to capillary evaporation were identified. In the initial stage of layer adsorption, the surface state and radius of the pore affected the coordination structure of water around silanol groups. In the pore-filling state, the hydrogen bond network of water in the pore was similar but not the same as that in the bulk liquid; the difference was because the pore wall affected the position of water molecules. This difference may confer unique dynamic properties upon the water in mesoporous silica.},

	abstract = {High-yield synthesis of the iron?sulfur cluster [\{N(SiMe3)2\}\{SC(NMe2)2\}Fe4S3]2(?6-S) \{?-N(SiMe3)2\}2 (1), which reproduces the [8Fe-7S] core structure of the nitrogenase PN-cluster, has been achieved via two pathways: (1) Fe\{N(SiMe3)2\}2 + HSTip (Tip = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2) + tetramethylthiourea (SC(NMe2)2) + elemental sulfur (S8); and (2) Fe3\{N(SiMe3)2\}2(?-STip)4 (2) + HSTip + SC(NMe2)2 + S8. The thiourea and terminal amide ligands of 1 were found to be replaceable by thiolate ligands upon treatment with thiolate anions and thiols at ?40 °C, respectively, and a series of [8Fe-7S] clusters bearing two to four thiolate ligands have been synthesized and their structures were determined by X-ray analysis. The structures of these model [8Fe-7S] clusters all closely resemble that of the reduced form of P-cluster (PN) having 8Fe(II) centers, while their 6Fe(II)?2Fe(III) oxidation states correspond to the oxidized form of P-cluster (POX). The cyclic voltammograms of the [8Fe-7S] clusters reveal two quasi-reversible one-electron reduction processes, leading to the 8Fe(II) state that is the same as the PN-cluster, and the synthetic models demonstrate the redox behavior between the two major oxidation states of the native P-cluster. Replacement of the SC(NMe2)2 ligands in 1 with thiolate anions led to more negative reduction potentials, while a slight positive shift occurred upon replacement of the terminal amide ligands with thiolates. The clusters 1, (NEt4)2[\{N(SiMe3)2\}(SC6H4-4-Me)Fe4S3]2(?6-S)\{?-N(SiMe3)2\}2 (3a), and [(SBtp)\{SC(NMe2)2\}Fe4S3]2(?6-S)\{?-N(SiMe3)2\}2 (5; Btp = 2,6-(SiMe3)2C6H3) are EPR silent at 4?100 K, and their temperature-dependent magnetic moments indicate a singlet ground state with antiferromagnetic couplings among the iron centers. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of these clusters are consistent with the 6Fe(II)?2Fe(III) oxidation state, each exhibiting two doublets with an intensity ratio of ca. 1:3, which are assignable to Fe(III) and Fe(II), respectively. Comparison of the quadrupole splittings for 1, 3a, and 5 has led to the conclusion that two Fe(III) sites of the clusters are the peripheral iron atoms.},

	abstract = {We consider an osmotic equilibrium between bulk solutions of polyelectrolyte bounded by semi-permeable membranes and separated by a thin film of salt-free liquid. Although the membranes are neutral, the counter-ions of the polyelectrolyte molecules permeate into the gap and lead to a steric charge separation. This gives rise to a distance-dependent membrane potential, which translates into a repulsive electrostatic disjoining pressure. From the solution of the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation, we obtain the distribution of the potential and of ions. We then derive an explicit formula for the pressure exerted on the membranes and show that it deviates from the classical van't Hoff expression for the osmotic pressure. This difference is interpreted in terms of a repulsive electrostatic disjoining pressure originating from the overlap of counterion clouds inside the gap. We also develop a simplified theory based on a linearized Poisson–Boltzmann approach. A comparison with simulation of a primitive model for the electrolyte is provided and does confirm the validity of the theoretical predictions. Beyond the fundamental result that the neutral surfaces can repel, this mechanism not only helps to control the adhesion and long-range interactions of living cells, bacteria, and vesicles, but also allows us to argue that electrostatic interactions should play enormous role in determining behavior and functions of systems bounded by semi-permeable membranes.},

The structures possess local pair and multisite correlation functions that mimic those of the corresponding random bcc alloy. The introduction of these SQS’s allows for the possibility of first-principles calculations of bcc solid solutions, even those with significant size-mismatch or atomic relaxation. We have tested our SQS’s via first-principles calculations in the Mo–Nb, Ta–W and Cr–Fe systems, in which the bcc solid solution is observed to be stable over the whole composition range. Our first-principles SQS results provide formation enthalpies, equilibrium lattice parameters and magnetic moments of these bcc alloys which agree satisfactorily with most existing experimental data in the literature. In an effort to understand the atomic relaxation behavior in bcc solid solutions, we have also investigated the nearest neighbor bond length distributions in the random bcc alloys. The proposed bcc SQS’s are quite general and can be applied to other binary bcc alloys.},

	abstract = {The electronic and spin structures of the [8Fe–7S] inorganic model complex (1) have been investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) UB3LYP and UBLYP methods. The experimental geometry of 1 was used to calculate the sets of exchange interactions (J values) between Fe-spin centers within spin Hamiltonian models. The experimental temperature-dependent paramagnetism is well reproduced on the basis of the calculated J values. The calculated low-lying energy levels are also consistent with those of the experiments. This indicates that the ground spin state of 1 is singlet (S = 0) for the weak antiferromagnetic coupling between two [4Fe–3S] cubane units, which take the Fe(III)Fe(II)3 formal charge and S = 7/2 spin states. The first-order density matrix of the most stable broken-symmetry (BS) solution has been diagonalized to elucidate the natural molecular orbitals (MOs) and their occupation number of 1, which are hardly obtained by the symmetry-adapted (SA) CASSCF approach. Several chemical indices such as the effective bond orders before and after spin projection are also calculated by using the occupation numbers to provide the SA MO picture of labile chemical bonds of 1. It is found that the BS MO calculation followed by spin-projected SA analysis is an effective and practical alternative to the CASSCF MO approach for the multinuclear transition metal clusters. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It uses strictly localized pseudoatomic orbitals as basis functions. The sparse Hamiltonian and overlap matrices are calculated with an O(N) effort. The long-range self-consistent potential and its matrix elements are computed in a real-space grid. The other matrix elements are directly calculated and tabulated as a function of the interatomic distances. The computation of the total energy and atomic forces is also done in O(N) operations using truncated, Wannier-like localized functions to describe the occupied states, and a band-energy functional which is iteratively minimized with no orthogonality constraints. We illustrate the method with several examples, including carbon and silicon supercells with up to 1000 Si atoms and supercells of β-C3N4. We apply the method to solve the existing controversy about the faceting of large icosahedral fullerenes by performing dynamical simulations on C60, C240, and C540.},

 we obtain a perturbative expansion for the time dependent particle density using volume fraction f of spheres as an expansion parameter. The exact single particle t operator for partially absorbing boundary condition is used to obtain a closed form time dependent diffusion coefficient D(t) accurate to first order in the volume fraction f. Short and long time limits of D(t) are checked against the known short time results for partially or fully absorbing boundary conditions and long time results for reflecting boundary conditions. For fully absorbing boundary condition the long time diffusion coefficient is found to be D(t) = 5a2/(12fD0t)+O((D0t/a2)−2) to the first order of perturbation theory. Here f is small but nonzero, D0 the diffusion coefficient in the absence of spheres, and a the radius of the spheres. The validity of this perturbative result is discussed.},

	abstract = {La physique des surfaces est une science à la fois ancienne et récente. Ancienne parce que les premiers concepts ayant permis d'étudier les surfaces datent du début du XXe siècle. Récente parce que l'étude approfondie et systématique des surfaces n'a démarré qu'à partir des années 1960, pour finalement connaître un essor extrêmement important aujourd'hui, en plein règne des nanosciences. Cet ouvrage offre une large vision de la physique des surfaces solides, depuis les concepts thermodynamiques de base, jusqu'à la surface considérée comme lieu d'échange entre un cristal et son environnement. Une large part de l'ouvrage est consacrée à l'étude des propriétés spécifiques de surface ainsi qu'aux méthodes expérimentales d'étude des surfaces depuis les techniques de laboratoire les plus répandues jusqu'à celles utilisant le rayonnement synchrotron. Une attention particulière est portée aux problèmes d'épitaxie. Les approximations et modèles utilisés permettent une approche analytique claire aidant le lecteur à se faire une idée physique malgré la complexité de certains problèmes étudiés. Des exercices de difficultés variables complètent le cours. Ce livre est destiné aux étudiants de Maîtrise, de 3e cycle de physique ou de chimie de la matière condensée, et aux ingénieurs.},

This theory is based on the so-called microscopic energy-gap coordinate and relies on a Gaussian solvation picture or, equivalently, on a linear response approximation. It involves two parameters, the reorganization energy and the reaction free energy parameters. However, it may fail when the solvation has a different character in the reactant and product state. For that situation, we describe a complementary theoretical extension, based on a non-Gaussian solvation picture, and we discuss its implications for electron transfer rate constants and rate constant/reaction free energy relationships. Relying on molecular simulation results, we show that such situation arise even for simple half oxido-reduction reactions involving the Cu+/Cu2+ or Ag0 /Ag+ couples or for generic charge transfer reactions involving high polarizability changes. The non-Gaussian theory exhibits the correct non-linear response behavior and reproduces the simulation results quantitatively, whereas a simple one-Gaussian-state Marcus description breaks down.},

However, PDF analysis indicates that the TiO(2) framework connectivity is maintained throughout lithium intercalation, with expansions along the a and b axes. The Li(+) ions within the framework are poorly observed in the X-ray PDF, which is dominated by contributions from the more strongly scattering Ti and O atoms. First-principles calculations were used to identify energetically favorable Li(+) sites within the Brookite lattice and to develop a complete structural model of the lithiated material. This model replicates the local structure and decreased intermediate range order observed in the PDF data. The analysis suggests that local structural distortions of the TiO(2) lattice accommodate lithium in five-coordinate sites. This structural model is consistent with the observed electrochemical behavior.},

A previously developed self-consistent scheme [S. Buyukdagli, C. V. Achim, and T. Ala-Nissila, J. Stat. Mech. 2011, P05033] and a new simpler variational procedure that self-consistently couple image forces, surface charge induced electric field, and pore modified core interactions are used to this aim. For neutral pores, it is shown that with increasing pore size, the theory predicts a transition of the interplate pressure from an attractive to a strongly repulsive regime associated with an ionic packing state, an effect observed in previous Monte Carlo simulations for hard core charges. We also establish the mean-field theory of the model and show that for dielectrically homogeneous pores, the mean-field regime of the interaction between the walls corresponds to large pores of size d {\textgreater} 4 Å. The role of the range of core interactions in the ionic rejection and interplate pressure is thoroughly analyzed. We show that the physics of the system can be split into two screening regimes. The ionic packing effect takes place in the regime of moderately screened core interactions characterized with the bare screening parameter of the Yukawa potential b ≲ 3/ℓB, where ℓB is the Bjerrum length. In the second regime of strongly screened core interactions b ≳ 3/ℓB, solvation forces associated with these interactions positively contribute to the ionic rejection driven by electrostatic forces and enhance the magnitude of the attractive pressure. For weakly charged pores without a dielectric discontinuity, core interactions make a net repulsive contribution to the interplate force and also result in oscillatory pressure curves, whereas for intermediate surface charges, these interactions exclusively strengthen the external pressure, thereby reducing the magnitude of the net repulsive interplate force. The pronounced dependence of the interplate pressure and ionic partition coefficients on the magnitude and the range of core interactions indicates excluded volume effects as an important ion specificity and a non-negligible ingredient for the stability of macromolecules in electrolyte solutions.},

The endo-trans structure shows the lowest energy in both water and LiCl solution. The activation barrier of the reaction in LiCl solution is lower than that in water, and the difference is in good agreement with that from experiments. The decrease in the activation barrier arises from destabilization of the reactant species.

Applying the quasi-degenerate perturbation theory in a subspace of rationally selected multiconfigurational adiabatic wavefunctions leads to the construction of an effective Hamiltonian, the solutions of which do not exhibit the previously mentioned defects.

Calculations based on a single-scattering theory show that half of the Cr deposited at 296°C is below the surface.

Exploiting the different sampling depths for proton and electron excitation, we could quantitatively evaluate the layer-dependent concentration profiles of Cr and Fe near the film surface and their evolution in time. For a coverage of 1 ML, more than half of the deposited Cr atoms have undergone place exchange with Fe substrate atoms, which results in a mixed first and second layer. For 2 ML, the first and second layer consist predominantly of Cr. Long-time measurements show that as-grown 1-ML films are not stable. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The ground-state excess energies calculated by the Monte Carlo method are very precise and in agreement with those of other calculations in the metallic density range and in the very-low-density Wigner crystals. Three phases have been investigated: the Wigner crystal, the normal or unpolarized fluid, and the polarized fluid. The Wigner crystal has the lowest energy for rs{\textgreater}67 in three dimensions and rs{\textgreater}33 in two dimensions. The totally polarized quantum fluid is stable for 26{\textless}rs{\textless}67 in three dimensions and for 13{\textless}rs{\textless}33 in two dimensions, and the normal or unpolarized fluid is stable at higher densities rs{\textless}26 in three dimensions and rs{\textless}13 in two dimensions. A pseudopotential with no adjustable parameters, derived from the random-phase approximation, is found to give excellent energies. The present results lend support to earlier conjectures that the ground state of the electron gas will be spin polarized at intermediate densities.},

	abstract = {New classes of acidic or basic ionic liquids (ILs) are gaining special attention, since the efficiency of many processes can be enhanced by the judicious manipulation of these properties. The absorption of sour gases can be enhanced by the basic character of the IL. The fluorination of the cation or the anion can also contribute to enhance the gas solubility. In this work these two characteristics are evaluated through the study of the gas-liquid equilibrium of two ionic liquids based on similar anions, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][Ac]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate ([C4mim][TFA]), with carbon dioxide (CO2) at temperatures up to 363 K and pressures up to 76 MPa. The data reported are shown to be thermodynamically consistent. Henry's constants estimated from the experimental data show the solubility of CO2 on the [C4mim][Ac] to be spontaneous unlike in [C4mim][TFA] due to the differences in solvation enthalpies in these systems. Ab initio calculations were performed on simple intermolecular complexes of CO2 with acetate and trifluoroacetate using MP2/6-31G(d) and the G3 and G3MP2 theoretical procedures to understand the interactions between CO2 and the anions. The theoretical study indicates that although both anions exhibit a simultaneous interaction of the two oxygen of the carboxylate group with the CO2, the acetate acts as a stronger Lewis base than the trifluoroacetate. 13C high-resolution and magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectra provide further evidence for the acid/base solvation mechanism and the stability of the acetate ion on these systems. Further similarities and differences observed between the two anions in what concerns the solvation of CO2 are discussed.},

The ionic friction is described in terms of the response of collective excitations in solvent to a solute displacement, and the resultant formula expresses the friction as an amount of the energy dissipated during the relaxational processes after the solute perturbation. Utilizing this viewpoint, the ionic friction is shown to be naturally decomposed into hydrodynamic and dielectric contributions and their coupling. It is demonstrated from theoretical calculations of the ionic frictions that both classical pictures, the solventberg and dielectric friction pictures, are responsible for large frictions of small ions, and that the coupling term, which has been disregarded in theoretical considerations so far, should also be properly taken into account in dealing with small ions. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {We adapt the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) to calculate the potentials of mean force for ion–molecular solution as a difference between the chemical potential of solvation of a cluster of solutes and of individual ones. The method yields the solvation structure around the cluster of solutes in detail. The solvation chemical potential is obtained for the three-dimensional hypernetted chain (3D-HNC) closure as well as for its partial linearization (3D-PLHNC approximation). The solvation chemical potential is obtained in a closed analytical form for both the 3D-HNC and 3D-PLHNC closures. The 3D-RISM integral equations are solved by using the supercell technique. A straightforward supercell treatment of ionic solute in polar molecular solvent leads to a big error in the potential of mean force as well as the solvation chemical potential, which for simple ions in water amounts to about 35 kcal/mol. We elaborated corrections to the 3D-RISM integral equations, alleviating the artifact of the supercell periodicity with an accuracy of 0.05 kcal/mol or better and restoring the long-range asymptotics of the solute–solvent correlation functions. The dielectrically consistent site–site RISM/HNC theory (DRISM/HNC) is employed for the solvent correlations to provide a proper description of the dielectric properties of solution. This allowed us to extend the description to solution at a finite salt concentration. We converge both the 3D-RISM and site–site DRISM integral equations by using the method of modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace. Owing to the proper initial guess of the correlation functions,iteration begins at once for a given temperature and full molecular charge, avoiding a gradual decrease of the temperature and increase of the site charges, which greatly reduces the computation time. We calculate and discuss the potentials of mean force for sodium chloride in ambient water at infinite dilution as well as at a finite concentration.},

	abstract = {Despite its widespread use the Ewald summation method has been criticized for introducing spatial periodicity in the simulation system. The question whether this leads to artifacts is rigorously addressed by comparing the electric field obtained with the Ewald method to that of an unmodified Coulomb potential. It is demonstrated that the Ewald potential ϕEW is a solution of the Poisson equation under toroidal (periodic) boundary conditions; however, ϕEW gives also rise to an implicit contribution analogous to a reaction field. This additional term is connected to the dielectric boundary conditions employed in the simulation, and we show how to adjust these in a physically meaningful manner by adding an explicit reaction field term. To verify the theoretical considerations and to study the effects which modifying the dielectric boundary conditions has on the properties of the simulated system, we calculate the static dielectric constant, the distance-dependent G-factor, and the relaxation time of the net dipole moment of SPC water. The commonly used tin-foil boundary conditions (characterized by a formal dielectric constant {\textbackslash}documentclass\{article\}{\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\$ {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{EW\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{eff\}\}\} \${\textbackslash}end\{document\} = ∞) are found to overstabilize the correlation between dipoles at larger distances; therefore, we recommend to adjust the dielectric boundary conditions so that {\textbackslash}documentclass\{article\}{\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\$ {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{EW\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{eff\}\}\} = {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_0 \${\textbackslash}end\{document\}, where ϵ0 is the intrinsic static dielectric constant of the simulated system.},

	abstract = {We present a theory for the temperature-dependent nuclear magnetic shielding tensor of molecules with arbitrary electronic structure. The theory is a generalization of Ramsey's theory for closed-shell molecules. The shielding tensor is defined as a second derivative of the Helmholtz free energy of the electron system in equilibrium with the applied magnetic field and the nuclear magnetic moments. This derivative is analytically evaluated and expressed as a sum over states formula. Special consideration is given to a system with an isolated degenerate ground state for which the size of the degeneracy and the composition of the wave functions are arbitrary. In this case, the paramagnetic part of the shielding tensor is expressed in terms of the g and A tensors of the electron paramagnetic resonance spin Hamiltonian of the degenerate state. As an illustration of the proposed theory, we provide an explicit formula for the paramagnetic shift of the central lanthanide ion in endofullerenes Ln@C60, with Ln = Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Dy3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, where the ground state can be a strongly spin-orbit coupled icosahedral sextet for which the paramagnetic shift cannot be described by previous theories.},

The algorithmic modifications that have to be introduced into the usual density matrix renormalization group scheme in order to spin adapt it are discussed, and it is demonstrated that the introduced modifications do not change the overall scaling of the method. The new approach is tested on HNCO, a model system, that has a singlet-triplet curve crossing between states of the same symmetry. The advantages of the spin-adapted DMRG scheme are discussed, and it is concluded that the spin-adapted DMRG method converges better in almost all cases and gives more parallel curves to the full configuration interaction result than the non-spin-adapted method. It is shown that the spin-adapted DMRG energies can be lower than the ones obtained from the non-spin-adapted scheme. Such a counterintuitive result is explained by noting that the spin-adapted method is not a special case of the non-spin-adapted one; consequently, the spin-adapted result is not an upper bound for the non-spin-adapted energy.},

Electrochemical and electrical double-layer characteristics of novel carbon materials in the acetonitrile solution of triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate were obtained by using cyclic voltammetry and constant current methods. Carbon electrode materials of this study were tested over the temperature range from −10 °C to +60 °C.

The electrostatic attraction between the polyelectrolyte and the surface and the entropy loss of the encapsulated polyelectrolyte chain dictate the optimum conditions for encapsulation. Two scenarios of encapsulation are identified: entropy-dominated and adsorption-dominated encapsulation. In the entropy-dominated encapsulation regime, the polyelectrolyte chain is delocalized, and the optimum radius of the encapsulating sphere decreases with increasing the attraction. In the adsorption-dominated encapsulation regime, the polyelectrolyte chain is strongly localized near the surface, and the optimum radius increases with increasing the attraction. After identifying a universal encapsulation parameter, the dependencies of the optimum radius on the salt concentration, surface charge density, polymer charge density, and polymer length are explored.},

	abstract = {The dominating fraction of the power generated by fusion in the reactor is captured by neutron moderation in the blanket surrounding the plasma. From this, the efficiency of the fusion plant is predominated by the technologies applied to make electricity or hydrogen from the neutrons. The main blanket concepts addressed in this paper are advanced ceramic breeder concepts, dual coolant blankets as well as self-cooled liquid metal and Flibe blankets. Two important questions that are addressed are: (i) Can we draw a bottom line conclusion on the most promising concept(s)? (ii) What are the common issues to be resolved independently from individual design and layout proposals to define a feasible route towards advanced fusion reactors? For ceramic breeder concepts, a key issue in the long term could be the limitation of beryllium as the considered multiplier in terms of world sources and achievable temperature levels. For liquid metal blankets, attractive long-term visions have been developed but major technological challenges also exist for the in-vessel blanket technology and the corresponding sub-systems.

The transition causes a sharp peak in the potential dependence of the differential capacitance of the interface. This result is in qualitative agreement with recently reported experimental work on the interface between a room temperature ionic liquid and a well-defined Au(100) surface. In the LiCl/Al simulations, the transition occurs when the interaction model includes the induction of dipoles on the ions of the liquid by their mutual interaction and their interaction with the electrode surface as well as the polarization of the metal by the charges and dipoles on the ions (?image? interactions). When the electrode or ion polarization effects are not included, the transition is no longer observed. The interaction between the induced charges on the metal atoms and the induced dipoles on the ions creates an additional screening, which stabilizes the formation of a crystalline layer at the anode. When the crystallographic plane of the metal is changed to (110) instead of (100), the two first adsorbed layer are crystalline on both the anode and the cathode, but the structure is different: the crystal is formed through an epitaxial mechanism to adapt to the electrode surface structure. In the case of the (110) crystallographic plane, the charging of the adsorbed layer occurs through the formation of nonstoichiometric crystalline layers.},

	abstract = {In this work, the melting point and the phase diagram of methanol is determined via computer simulations using the OPLS model. The three different solid structures that are found experimentally were considered. By computing the free energies of both the fluid phase and the three different solid structures (alpha, beta, gamma), the initial solid-solid and fluid-solid coexistence points were determined. By performing Gibbs-Duhem integration, the complete coexistence lines were evaluated. In this way, it was possible to compute, for the first time, the complete phase diagram for a potential model of methanol. It is found that the optimized potential model for liquid simulations (OPLS) provides reasonable predictions for the densities of the three solid polymorphs, although they tend to be somewhat low when compared with the experiment. Overall the model provides a qualitatively correct description of the phase diagram of methanol. The beta solid, which is thermodynamically stable in the experimental phase diagram of methanol, is found to be metastable in the phase diagram of the model. The alpha phase is stable at low pressures and the gamma phase is stable at high pressures, in agreement with experiment. Thus, the model is able to predict the existence of the gamma solid at high pressure. From free energy calculations we found that the melting point of the model at room pressure is 215 K. That was further confirmed by direct coexistence simulations. Thus, the model presents a melting point about 40 K above the experimental value of 175 K. Thus the OPLS model provides a reasonable description of the phase diagram of methanol, but it could probably be modified to improve the phase diagram predictions.},

We confirm that a proper description of the relaxation is obtained by taking into account the quadrupole moment of benzene molecules. In contrast to the Xe–water system, the cross‐correlation contribution to the electric field gradient (experienced by the Xe nucleus) is negligible in benzene, and the time correlation function of the total electric field gradient shows a relatively smooth decay. Several molecular motions take part in this decay, but not with the same efficiency. The major contribution can be attributed to the rotation of the benzene molecules around their C2 axes. The adequacy of the Sternheimer model for quadrupolar interactions is confirmed with ab initio calculations. Some methodological aspects of simulations are also discussed, such as the use of a termination function to treat the electrostatic interactions and the effect of the xenon interaction parameters on the simulated relaxation rate.},

The elastic polyelectrolyte network model treats humic substance particles as composed by two parts, an external one directly in contact with the solution, and an internal part or gel fraction which is considered, from a statistical point of view, as a charged polymer network swelled by the electrolyte solution, in the framework of the Flory polymer network theory. The electrostatic effect is given by a Donnan-like potential, which can be regarded as an average value over the gel fraction of the humic particle. The gel fraction expands as the pH and humic charge are increased, determining the Donnan potential and consequently the ion activity inside the gel. The model was fitted to published experimental data with good agreement. The model predictions are discussed, and the behavior suggests, for some cases, the presence of a transition between closed and open structures attributed to the presence, at low pH, of intramolecular hydrogen bonds which are removed as the carboxylic sites become deprotonated.},

Time-integration is performed using a midpoint algorithm and Chebyshev polynomial approximation proposed by Fixman. This approach is applied to the dynamics of a genomic DNA molecule driven by flow through a nanofluidic slit with an array of nanopits on one wall of the slit. The dynamics of the DNA molecule was studied as a function of the Péclet number and chain length (the base case being λ-DNA). The transport characteristics of the hopping dynamics in this device differ at low and high Péclet number, and for long DNA, relative to the pit size, the dynamics is governed by the segments residing in the pit. By comparing with results that neglect them, hydrodynamic interactions are shown to play an important quantitative role in the hopping dynamics.},

In the monolayer regime, three different adsorbed amounts corresponding to increasing fillings of the interlayer space were investigated whereas two situations (adsorption and desorption) were investigated in the bilayer region. In a first step, molecular dynamics were used to reexamine some of the approximations classically used in the analysis of water motion by QENS (i.e., separation between rotational and translational diffusion, preferred orientation of molecules, and contribution to the elastic incoherent structure factor). A careful analysis of experimental data obtained at two wavelengths and for two orientations of the clay platelets and validated by simulations yielded rotational and translational movements of water molecules in the clay interlayer. Two rotational movements at two different time scales are revealed. The faster one is rather independent of the adsorbed water amount whereas the slower one assigned to the rotation of hydrated cations is significantly slowed down in the monolayer regime, especially upon completion of the first water layer. Translational movements are limited in the longitudinal direction and are significantly slower than in bulk water in the radial direction, even in the bilayer regime.},

Alternatively, a hydronium ion is created by increasing the proton coordination to three. These two pathways are compared to a previous ab initio MD study by Trout and Parrinello [B.L. Trout, M. Parrinello, Chem. Phys. Lett. 288 (1998) 343] who used a constraint on OH bond length. The resulting numerical estimates of pKw=13±1 are in good agreement.

	abstract = {When the viscosity of a supercooled liquid becomes large, the mechanism of mass transport is known to undergo a change from viscosity dependent, Stokes–Einstein behavior to an activated hopping dominated, almost viscosity independent behavior. This change is known to occur rather sharply near the temperature Tc where the mode coupling theory predicts singularities in the transport properties of the liquid. However, the origin of this change in the transport mechanism is not well‐understood. Here we suggest a simple microscopic interpretation of this crossover. Our analysis is based on a scaled particle theory calculation of the activation energy for hopping and the non‐Markovian rate theory of activated barrier crossing. We find that as the liquid is progressively supercooled, the activation barrier for hopping increases rapidly which makes the curvature at the barrier top also to increase. At high densities the latter gives almost a viscosity independent hopping rate which becomes more dominant at large viscosities where the collective diffusion becomes inefficient. The suddenness of the crossover is because as the density is increased, the hopping rate also decreases rapidly because of the increase in the activation energy, and a rapid increase in viscosity is required to tilt the balance in favor of the hopping mechanism. The latter can only happen at a dynamic singularity where the viscosity undergoes a sharp increase. The present analysis also offers an explanation of the decoupling of structural relaxation from the viscosity at large values of latter—such a decoupling has been suggested recently by Angell. Our analysis also provides a tentative explanation of the recent simulation results of Keyes and co‐workers. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm for density-functional-theory-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is presented. The Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in Gaussian-type functions and an augmented-plane-wave-type approach is used to represent the electronic density. This extends previous work of ours where the density was expanded only in plane waves. We describe the total density in a smooth extended part which we represent in plane waves as in our previous work and parts localised close to the nuclei which are expanded in Gaussians. Using this representation of the charge we show how the localised and extended part can be treated separately, achieving a computational cost for the calculation of the Kohn–Sham matrix that scales with the system size N as O(NlogN). Furthermore, we are able to reduce drastically the size of the plane-wave basis. In addition, we introduce a multiple-cutoff method that improves considerably the performance of this approach. Finally, we demonstrate with a series of numerical examples the accuracy and efficiency of the new algorithm, both for electronic structure calculations and for ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.},

Il cherche à montrer que rien n'est le fait du hasard, même dans ce domaine où, pourtant, l'immense variété des compositions et des structures évoque plus le chaos que l'ordre. La composition chimique ou isotopique comme la structure cristalline des argiles, résultent de l'exercice de quelques lois relativement simples dont les énoncés sont tout à fait accessibles aux premiers et seconds cycles universitaires. L'illustration abondante est destinée à faciliter la compréhension et la préparation d'exposés ou de cours. Ce livre s'adresse à tous les débutants dans cette science (géologues, géographes, ingénieurs environnementalistes, enseignants...). Il se veut davantage un outil pour comprendre qu'une compilation de données et de faits d'observation. L'approche choisie est celle du raisonnement et de la déduction logique. On y trouvera d'abord une méthode pour dessiner la structure de ces minéraux, calculer la dimension de leur maille cristalline et utiliser la diffraction de rayons X (et d'autres techniques) pour les identifier puis l'énoncé des lois thermodynamiques et cinétiques qui contrôlent leur formation. On y propose leur application dans la genèse ou la transformation des argiles dans les principaux sites naturels de surface et subsurface (sols, altérations, sédiments, diagenèse, hydrothermalisme). Enfin, le dernier chapitre est un clin d'œil adressé à ceux qui pensent " boue " en entendant " argile " : ces minéraux peuvent se former dans des conditions beaucoup plus exotiques : météorites, coulées de laves ou zones de subduction, par exemple.},

We use a simple quadratic Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian to show that the symmetry of interaction between density and vectorial polarization might lead to a striking enhancement of the polarizability at a certain finite wavelength. A similar effect in water has been obtained in recent computer simulations in accordance with neutron diffraction data and predicted by molecular theories. Here, we suggest that the coupling between density and polarization fluctuations might be one of the sources of this behaviour and discuss the conditions for its realization. A closed-form expression is derived for the wave-vector (k-) dependent response function and compared with computer simulation and diffraction data. The expression may be used as a simple analytical framework for describing dielectric screening in polar liquids. Implications of the resonance shape of the response function in k-space are studied for the interionic mean force potential and for the reorganization energy of electron exchange reactions between two ions.},

The clusters have diamagnetic ground states that yield spectra consisting of one quadrupole doublet with a large splitting (25\% of absorption) and one (3) or two (2) doublets with much smaller splittings (75\% of absorption). These patterns closely resemble those observed for all-ferrous 4Fe?4S clusters. Structurally, the 4Fe?4S fragments of 2 and 3 are remarkably similar to all-ferrous 4Fe?4S clusters, sharing with them the characteristic 3:1 pattern of the iron sites, a differentiation that has been shown previously to reflect spontaneous distortions of the cluster core. These spectroscopic and geometric similarities suggest that the diamagnetic ground state of the 8Fe?8S cluster results from antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of two identical 4Fe?4S modules, each carrying spin S4Fe = 4. The iron atoms with the largest quadrupole splittings are located at the opposite ends of the body diagonal containing the bridging sulfides.},

	abstract = {In a molecular frame rigidly bound to the contrast agent, the instantaneous zero-field splitting (ZFS) Hamiltonian acting on the Gd3+ electronic spin, S, has a constant mean value, named static ZFS (Hamiltonian). Expressed in the laboratory frame, the static ZFS has a random variation with time, which stems from the Brownian rotation of the complex and can be the source of a fast electronic spin relaxation that significantly quenches the relaxivity at low field. Except in a few cases, the static ZFS is too large and the Brownian rotation is too slow for the electronic relaxation to be described by Redfield analytical equations. Here, we present a formalism for simulating the quantum time correlation functions (TCFs) of the electronic spin operators, which properly account for relaxivity quenching by electronic relaxation. Though the formalism can be used at all field values, the interpretation of the high-field relaxivity with the help of simple justified analytical equations is recommended. The simulation procedure is illustrated by the case study of a model of the complex Gddtpa [Gd3+(dtpa)(H2O)]2– (dtpa5– = diethylenetriamine pentaacetate). The numerical implementation of the simulation at several levels of parallel computing is examined.},

Simulations which made use of this ab initio derived polarizable interaction potential reproduced the structure and dynamical properties of crystalline cryolite, Na3AlF6, rather well. The transferability of the potential model from solid state to the molten state is tested by comparing results for the Raman spectra of melts of various compositions with those previously obtained with empirically developed potentials and with experimental data. The shapes of the spectra and their evolution with composition in the mixtures conform quite well to those seen experimentally, and we discuss the relationship between the bands seen in the spectra and the vibrational modes of the AlFn(3?n) coordination complexes which are found in the NaF/AlF3 mixtures. The simulations thus enable a link between the structure of the melt as derived through Raman spectroscopy and through diffraction experiments. We report results for quantities which relate to the degree of cross-linking between these coordination complexes and the diffusive properties of ions.},

The basic techniques are briefly introduced and some successful applications of the model are exemplified: they deal with the inversion of phase stability in Ni4Mo, the existence of capillarity-like effects, the various dissolution modes of ordered precipitates and the effects of cascade size and density on two-phase equilibria under irradiation.},

In fact, microscopic theories have repeatedly failed to reproduce the Hubbard–Onsager–Zwanzig expression under any limiting conditions. We show in this article that the existing molecular theories and the continuum model treatments calculate two entirely different contributions to the friction on the ion. While the former calculates the contribution from the solvent density mode alone, the latter includes only the contribution from the current mode. Thus the existing molecular theories can never be reduced to the Hubbard–Onsager (H–O) theory. In addition, we show that the existing molecular theories become inconsistent for larger ions where the H–O theory is accurate. The reverse is true for smaller ions. An expression is derived here which is valid at both the limits and for all ion sizes and its consequences discussed. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

The MSA, and closely related closures of the wall-particle Ornstein-Zernike equation, are essentially linear-response approximations which neglect nonlinearities that are crucial in critical adsorption, even at the mean-field level. Our argument is made explicit by re-deriving the correct (Fisher–de Gennes) exponent ν-β and illustrating the failings of linearized treatments. Since the latter also fail to describe complete wetting, their validity is restricted to states well removed from bulk two-phase coexistence.},

The capacitance versus pore size (i.e., the C?d curve) was found to exhibit two peaks located at 0.7 and 1.4 nm, respectively. Specifically, as the pore shrinks from 1.0 to 0.7 nm, the capacitance of the micropore increases anomalously, in good agreement with experimental observations. We report herein that the second peak within 1.0 to 1.8 nm is a new feature of the C?d curve. Furthermore, by analogy to the wave interference, we demonstrate that the interference of two electrical double layers near each slit wall does not only explain the entire C?d curve, including the anomalous character, but also predicts the oscillatory behavior of C?d curve beyond 1.8 nm.},

Here, we explore the thermodynamic stability and dipolar orientation of such 1D water chains from nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions. We show that a dipole lattice model accurately recovers key properties of 1D confined water when compared to atomically detailed simulations. In a major reduction in computational complexity, we represent the dipole model in terms of effective Coulombic charges, which allows us to study pores of macroscopic lengths in equilibrium with a water bath (or vapor). We find that at ambient conditions, the water chains filling the tube are essentially continuous up to macroscopic dimensions. At reduced water vapor pressure, we observe a 1D Ising-like filling/emptying transition without a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. In the filled state, the chains of water molecules in the tube remain dipole-ordered up to macroscopic lengths of ≈0.1 mm, and the dipolar order is estimated to persist for times up to ≈0.1 s. The observed dipolar order in continuous water chains is a precondition for the use of nanoconfined 1D water as mediator of fast long-range proton transport, e.g., in fuel cells. For water-filled nanotube bundles and membranes, we expect anti-ferroelectric behavior, resulting in a rich phase diagram similar to that of a 2D Coulomb gas.},

	abstract = {A broadband depolarized light scattering (DLS) study is performed on diluted lysozyme aqueous solutions as a function of temperature and concentration. The dynamical susceptibility, obtained in a wide spectral range (0.6-36000 GHz) through the coupled use of interferometric and dispersive devices, is interpreted and compared with neutron scattering and Raman-induced optical Kerr-effect literature data, thus giving a general picture of relaxation phenomena. We show that the proposed approach represents a suitable tool for investigating the hydration dynamics of protein-water solutions. A detailed analysis of the quasi-elastic scattering region evidences the existence of two distinct relaxational processes at picosecond time scales. The fast process (fractions of picosecond) is attributed to bulk water dynamics, while the slow one (few picoseconds) is attributed to dynamical rearrangements of water molecules strongly influenced by the protein (hydration water). The retardation effect here estimated of about 6-7 can be regarded as a direct measure of the increased protein-water and water-water hydrogen bond stability of the water molecules within the protein hydration shell. Interestingly, a similar effect was previously observed on small hydrophilic sugar molecules. Moreover, backbone and side chains torsional motions of the protein in the 600-5300 GHz frequency range are found to be insensitive to thermal variations and to eventual changes occurring in the premelting zone.},

We test a simple analytic correction for the system-size effects that is based on hydrodynamic arguments. This correction scales as N-1/3, where N is the number of particles. For a cubic simulation box of length L, the diffusion coefficient corrected for system-size effects is D0 = DPBC + 2.837297kBT/(6π?L), where DPBC is the diffusion coefficient calculated in the simulation, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and ? the shear viscosity of the solvent. For water, LJ fluids, and hard-sphere fluids, this correction quantitatively accounts for the system-size dependence of the calculated self-diffusion coefficients. In contrast to diffusion coefficients, the shear viscosities of water and the LJ fluid show no significant system-size dependences.},

	abstract = {Standard continuum theory fails to predict several key experimental results of electrostatic and electrokinetic measurements at aqueous electrolyte interfaces. In order to extend the continuum theory to include the effects of molecular solvent structure, we generalize the equations for electrokinetic transport to incorporate a space dependent dielectric profile, viscosity profile, and non-electrostatic interaction potential. All necessary profiles are extracted from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that the MD results for the ion-specific distribution of counterions at charged hydrophilic and hydrophobic interfaces are accurately reproduced using the dielectric profile of pure water and a non-electrostatic repulsion in an extended Poisson?Boltzmann equation. The distributions of Na+ at both surface types and Cl? at hydrophilic surfaces can be modeled using linear dielectric response theory, whereas for Cl? at hydrophobic surfaces it is necessary to apply nonlinear response theory. The extended Poisson?Boltzmann equation reproduces the experimental values of the double-layer capacitance for many different carbon-based surfaces. In conjunction with a generalized hydrodynamic theory that accounts for a space dependent viscosity, the model captures the experimentally observed saturation of the electrokinetic mobility as a function of the bare surface charge density and the so-called anomalous double-layer conductivity. The two-scale approach employed here?MD simulations and continuum theory?constitutes a successful modeling scheme, providing basic insight into the molecular origins of the static and kinetic properties of charged surfaces, and allowing quantitative modeling at low computational cost.},

For this purpose, we have developed a classical model for the water–substrate interactions that solely depends on the coordinates of the particles and does not require the definition of geometrically smooth boundary surfaces or image planes. The model includes both an electrostatic induction for the metal atoms (determined by means of an extended Lagrangian technique) and a site‐specific treatment of the water–metal chemisorption. As a validation of the model we have investigated the structure of water monolayers on metal substrates of various topology [the (111), (110), and (100) crystallographic faces] and composition (Pt, Ag, Cu, and Ni), and compared the results to experiments. The modeling of the electrostatic induction is compatible with a finite external potential imposed on the metal. This feature is used to investigate the structural rearrangements of the water bilayer between the pair of scanning tunneling microscopeelectrodes in response to an applied external voltage difference. We find significant asymmetry in the dependence on the sign of the applied voltage. Another result of the calculation is an estimate of the perturbation to the work function caused by the wetting film. For the conditions typical for operation of a scanning tunneling microscope probe, the change in the work function is found to be comparable to the applied voltage (a few hundred millivolts).},

The materials selected included high purity irons, together with commercial mild and low alloy steels, high chromium (12-14\%) ferritic and martensitic stainless steels and a range of high purity binary iron-chromium alloys containing chromium contents up to 15\%. The pure irons and binary iron-chromium alloys exhibited measurable but relatively low swellings ({\textless}1\%) whilst all the commercial ferritic steels appeared to be void-swelling resistant, with swellings below the experimental detection limit (0.1\%). The pattern emerging is thus one of overall swelling resistance in ferritic materials as a general class. Void-swelling in the pure iron peaked at two irradiation temperatures ({\textasciitilde}420, {\textasciitilde}510°C), and the low magnitude of the swelling was rationalized in terms of the operation of solute-controlled swelling suppression mechanisms involving residual interstitial impurities. The complex functional dependence of peak-swelling on chromium content in the binary iron-chromium alloys was explained in terms of void-swelling suppression based on the presence of weak interactions between chromium atoms in solution and vacancies, modified by depletion of chromium from solid solution by [alpha]' precipitation at chromium contents exceeding 10\%. The validation of the high swelling resistance of the 12\% Cr martensitic stainless steels in a fast reactor environment provides confidence in the selection of these alloys as alternative core component materials for commercial fast reactor systems.},

The method makes explicit use of the dipole–dipole interaction tensor, and is thus easily generalizable to arbitrary forms of electrostatic interactions (e.g., Coulomb’s law with straight or smooth cutoff truncation). The convergence properties of the algorithm and the influence of various model parameters are investigated in detail, and a set of appropriate values for these parameters is determined. The algorithm is further tested by application to three types of systems (a single spherical ion, two spherical ions, and small biomolecules), and comparison with analytical results (single ion) and with results obtained using a finite-difference solver under periodic boundary conditions. The proposed algorithm performs very well in terms of accuracy and convergence properties, with an overall speed comparable in the current implementation to that of a typical finite-difference solver. Future developments and applications of the algorithm will include: (i) the assessment of periodicity- and cutoff-induced artifacts in explicit-solvent simulations; (ii) the design of new electrostatic schemes for explicit-solvent simulations mimicking more accurately bulk solution; (iii) a faster evaluation of solvation free energies based on continuum electrostatics in cases where periodicity-induced artifacts can be neglected.},

	abstract = {Owing to their scientific and technological importance, inorganic single crystals with highly reactive surfaces have long been studied. Unfortunately, surfaces with high reactivity usually diminish rapidly during the crystal growth process as a result of the minimization of surface energy. A typical example is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which has promising energy and environmental applications. Most available anatase TiO(2) crystals are dominated by the thermodynamically stable \{101\} facets (more than 94 per cent, according to the Wulff construction), rather than the much more reactive \{001\} facets. Here we demonstrate that for fluorine-terminated surfaces this relative stability is reversed: \{001\} is energetically preferable to \{101\}. We explored this effect systematically for a range of non-metallic adsorbate atoms by first-principle quantum chemical calculations. On the basis of theoretical predictions, we have synthesized uniform anatase TiO(2) single crystals with a high percentage (47 per cent) of \{001\} facets using hydrofluoric acid as a morphology controlling agent. Moreover, the fluorated surface of anatase single crystals can easily be cleaned using heat treatment to render a fluorine-free surface without altering the crystal structure and morphology.},

	abstract = {We propose an efficient and accurate scheme to calculate the melting point (MP) of materials. This method is based on the statistical analysis of small-size coexistence molecular dynamics simulations. It eliminates the risk of metastable superheated solid in the fast-heating method, while also significantly reducing the computer cost relative to the traditional large-scale coexistence method. Using empirical potentials, we validate the method and systematically study the finite-size effect on the calculated MPs. The method converges to the exact result in the limit of large system size. An accuracy within 100 K in MP is usually achieved when simulation contains more than 100 atoms. Density functional theory examples of tantalum, high-pressure sodium, and ionic material NaCl are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the method in its practical applications. The method serves as a promising approach for large-scale automated material screening in which the MP is a design criterion.},

	abstract = {By confining water in a nanoporous structure so narrow that the liquid could not freeze, it is possible to study properties of this previously undescribed system well below its homogeneous nucleation temperature TH = 231 K. Using this trick, we were able to study, by means of a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, vibrational spectra (HOH bending and OH-stretching modes) of deeply supercooled water in the temperature range 183 {\textless} T {\textless} 273 K. We observed, upon decreasing temperature, the building up of a new population of hydrogen-bonded oscillators centered around 3,120 cm(-1), the contribution of which progressively dominates the spectra as one enters into the deeply supercooled regime. We determined that the fractional weight of this spectral component reaches 50\% just at the temperature, TL approximately 225 K, where the confined water shows a fragile-to-strong dynamic cross-over phenomenon [Ito, K., Moynihan, C. T., Angell, C. A. (1999) Nature 398:492-494]. Furthermore, the fact that the corresponding OH stretching spectral peak position of the low-density-amorphous solid water occurs exactly at 3,120 cm(-1) [Sivakumar, T. C., Rice, S. A., Sceats, M. G. (1978) J. Chem. Phys. 69:3468-3476.] strongly suggests that these oscillators originate from existence of the low-density-liquid phase derived from the occurrence of the first-order liquid-liquid (LL) phase transition and the associated LL critical point in supercooled water proposed earlier by a computer molecular dynamics simulation [Poole, P. H., Sciortino, F., Essmann, U., Stanley, H. E. (1992) Nature 360:324-328].},

The ST2 model has an accessible liquid-liquid transition between low-density and high-density phases, making the model an ideal candidate to explore the impacts of the liquid-liquid transition on dynamics. We locate characteristic dynamical loci in the phase diagram and compare them with the previously investigated thermodynamic loci. The low-density liquid phase shows a crossover from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior, signaling the onset of a crossover from fragile-to-strong behavior. We explain this crossover in terms of the asymptotic approach of the low-density liquid to a random tetrahedral network and show that the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient over a wide temperature range can be simply related to the concentration of defects in the network. Our findings thus confirm that the low-density phase of ST2 water is a well-defined metastable liquid.},

Zero-level vibrational corrections to these quantities and spectroscopic constants also were computed. The level of agreement with experimental data is generally good, especially in the case of the light molecules. The field gradients at the Na and Cl nuclei in NaCl were analysed using the constrained spatial orbital variation technique in order to quantify the importance of polarization, charge transfer and Pauli repulsion contributions, and to understand why a simple electrostatic interpretation of the field gradients fails in the case of alkali halides. The dipole polarizabilities, Sternheimer antishielding constants γ∞ and electric field gradient–electric field hyperpolarizabilities ϵ of the alkali and halide ions also were calculated at a correlated level of theory (ACPF).},

	abstract = {Clay minerals and clay rocks are considered as efficient components of engineered and natural barriers in many high-level radioactive waste disposal programs worldwide because of their low permeabilities and high sorption capabilities. In this paper we present an approach for modeling solute diffusive transport in saturated clay minerals at the structure map scale based on an extension of the Kolmogorov?Dmitriev theory of stochastic branching processes. The proposed modeling framework allows a simple description of (i) the dual-porosity behavior typical of some compacted clay structures, where diffusion occurs both in the interlayers and in the pore space between clay particles, and (ii) the chemical interactions between the dissolved ions and the solid matrix surfaces (both at nonequilibrium and equilibrium conditions). Furthermore, the Markovian nature of the modeling approach lends itself to a continuous-time particle-tracking scheme of resolution of the model equations, which, in general, easily allows us to deal with the complex geometrical structures of the porous media. Finally, in order to account for the uncertainty in the geometrical properties of the clay samples within the proposed modeling framework, the structure map is represented as a stochastic network of interconnected, one-dimensional interlayers with different lengths and orientations. The combined methods are demonstrated on a two-dimensional literature case study of diffusion through a compacted clay sample, and the resulting average diffusion coefficients are in general agreement with those obtained by a different simulation-based technique found in the literature. Then, the methods are applied to model the diffusion of the weakly sorbing cation Na+, providing results in accordance with physical intuition.},

In particular, the potential can reproduce the strong interaction with self interstitial atoms characteristic of Fe-Cr alloys. The results, when compared to the case of pure Fe, show that the presence of Cr does not significantly influence either the ballistic phase of the cascade, or the primary damage state, in terms of number of surviving defects or clustered fraction. However, the fraction of Cr atoms in interstitial position greatly exceeds the alloy concentration, in agreement with some experimental indications, and this feature is expected to influence the long-term evolution of radiation damage in the alloy. The mechanisms leading to the accumulation of Cr in interstitial positions and the expected trapping effect on interstitial clusters are analysed and discussed.},

	abstract = {The P(2)O(5)-water system has the widest range of continuously glass-forming compositions known for any glassformer + water binary system. Despite the great range of structures explored by the glasses and liquids in this system, the glass transition temperature (T(g)) itself varies in a simple monotonic fashion. However the values of T(g) reported in the literature show wide disagreement, linked to the different methods of measurement employed. In this work we use differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to obtain both T(g) itself and the jump in heat capacity that occurs as the metastable equilibrium of the supercooled liquid relieves the non-ergodic glassy state. Our study covers the molar ratio range of H(2)O/P(2)O(5) from 1.5 to 14 (corresponding to the mass fraction of P(2)O(5) between 0.36 and 0.84), which includes the compositions corresponding to pyrophosphoric acid (H(4)P(2)O(7)) and orthophosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)). The theoretical model of Couchman and Karasz predicts very well the glass transition temperatures of the P(2)O(5)-H(2)O system over the whole composition range if the relatively large heat capacity change associated with water in aqueous solutions at the glass transition temperature is adopted, instead of the vanishingly small value observed for vapor deposited or hyperquenched pure water. Therefore, solvent water in this ambient pressure P(2)O(5)-H(2)O system behaves like a different liquid, more closely resembling a high-density liquid (HDL) polyamorph, as suggested by Mishima for electrolytes at high pressures.},

	abstract = {An electrolytic solution is simulated by a mixture of charged hard spheres and hard dipoles, all of the same size. This model can be solved exactly in the mean spherical approximation (MSA), yielding a set of three coupled high order algebraic equations for three unknowns, which are essentially the excess internal energies due to the charges alone, the dipoles alone, and the charge‐dipole cross interaction. A rapidly converging series solution of these equations is proposed for the dilute solution regime. The first term in this series is the hard‐core Debye‐Hückel theory term, with electrostrictive corrections. We also obtain the leading term in the expansion for the infinite dilution limit of the ion‐solvent excess chemical potential. Other relevant information could be obtained using standard formulas.},

An excellent agreement with experiment is obtained for the deuterium coupling in liquid D2O and a fair agreement for O-17 coupling in liquid (H2O)-O-17. The Ne-21 nmr relaxation time in liquid neon is calculated to be within about 20\% of experimental values, an exact comparison being difficult due to only roughly known pressures in the experiment and not adequately treated quantum effects in the simulations. Comparisons in the dense supercritical region at higher temperatures would be of interest, but experimental data are lacking.},

The calculations entailed the mutation of a water molecule and of a chloride ion to methane and the subsequent disappearance of the methane in the presence of 216 TIP4P solvent molecules. The NPT ensemble was used at 25°C and 1 atm, so Gibbs free energies were obtained. The mutations to methane proceeded with high precision, while the removal of the methane yielded an uncertainty of about ±0.3 kcal/mol in ΔG. The accord with experimental results is good in all cases; in particular, the computed free energy of TIP4P water is −6.1±0.3 kcal/mol, while the experimental value is −6.3 kcal/mol. The present results demonstrate the utility of statistical perturbation theory for computing absolute free energies of solution and the quality of the underlying potential functions.},

However, the low intrinsic electrical conductivity and poor cycling performance have limited its application. In this work, titanium dioxide flakes have been synthesized through a simple spreading method that is easily scalable. The calcined titanium dioxide flakes exhibit larger reversible charge/discharge capacity, better rate capability and excellent cycling stability compared to anatase titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The larger surface area of the flakes leads to a larger electrode/electrolyte contact area, shorter solid state path lengths for both Li-ion and electron transport, which results in the better rate capability. The cycling performance was significantly improved by the porous structure of the calcined titanium dioxide flakes. Strategies for improving the volumetric energy density of the flakes are also discussed.},

For the dynamics, the short time behavior of water as observed with quasielastic neutron scattering is in agreement with simulated one. For the ions, the experimental values are related to macroscopic long time motions and are much smaller than the short time values calculated from MD. Thus, the present study provides a detailed insight in the microscopic dynamics of ions related to the structure of the clay: it is shown that Cs+ diffuse faster than Na+ and that the arrangement of clay surfaces plays a significant role in the choice of the sites occupied by the cations as well as in their mobility. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

In contrast, CASSCF and CASPT2N/6-31G* calculations predict only small changes in ΔEST on substituting oxygen atoms for one or two methylene groups in m-benzoquinodimethane. After corrections for differences in zero-point energies and heat capacities, CASPT2N/6-31G* calculations give ΔEST = 11.0 kcal mol–1 for m-benzoquinodimethane, which is very close to the experimental value of ΔEST = 9.6 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1. At the same level of theory ΔEST = 9.3 and 11.8 kcal mol–1 are computed for, respectively, m-benzoquinomethane and m-benzoquinone. The reasons why substitution of oxygen atoms for one or two methylene groups is predicted to have such a small effect on ΔEST in these three diradicals is discussed. As expected, for 1,3-naphthoquinomethane CASPT2N predicts a value of ΔEST that is only slightly larger than that in m-benzoquinomethane. However, the calculated value of ΔEST = 11.6 kcal mol–1 is 7 kcal mol–1 lower than the value measured by photoacoustic calorimetry.},

The diffusion-reaction picture provides the usual interpretation of the reduced ionic mobility in clays, but the required partitioning coefficient Kd between trapped and mobile ions is generally an empirical parameter. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain Kd from the microscopic dynamics of ions interacting with the clay surfaces by evaluating the ionic mobility using a novel lattice implementation of the Fokker-Planck equation. The resulting Kd allows a clear-cut characterization of the trapping sites on the clay surfaces and determines the adsorption/desorption rates. The results highlight the limitations of standard approximation schemes and pinpoint the crossover from jump to Brownian diffusion regimes.},

The comparison of the Raman susceptibility chi(")(omega) of lysozyme/water and lysozyme/sugar/water solutions at a concentration of 40 wt \% with the chi(") of dry lysozyme suggests that the protein dynamics mostly appears in the broad peak around 60-80 cm(-1) that reflects the vibrations experienced by atoms within the cage formed by their neighbors, whereas the broad shoulder around 170 cm(-1) mainly stems from the intermolecular O-H...O stretching vibrations of water. The addition of sugars essentially induces a significant high frequency shift and intensity reduction of this band that reveal a slowing down of water dynamics and a distortion of the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network of water, respectively. Furthermore, the lysozyme vibrational densities of states (VDOS) have been determined from simulations of lysozyme in 37-60 wt \% disaccharide aqueous solutions. They exhibit an additional broad peak around 290 cm(-1), in line with the VDOS of globular proteins obtained in neutron scattering experiments. The influence of sugars on the computed VDOS mostly appears on the first peak as a slight high-frequency shift and intensity reduction in the low-frequency range (omega{\textless}50 cm(-1)), which increase with the sugar concentration and with the exposition of protein residues to the solvent. These results suggest that sugars stiffen the environment experienced by lysozyme atoms, thereby counteracting the softening of protein vibrational modes upon denaturation, observed at high temperature in the Raman susceptibility of the lysozyme/water solution and in the computed VDOS of unfolded lysozyme in water. Finally, the Raman susceptibility of sugar/water solutions and the calculated VDOS of water in the different lysozyme solutions confirm that sugars induce a significant strengthening of the hydrogen bond network of water that may stabilize proteins at high temperatures.},

We show the confining obstacles to profoundly impact the relaxation pattern of various quantifiers pertinent to the fluid. Varying the type of quantifier (tagged-particle or collective) as well as ϕm and ϕf, we unveil both discontinuous and continuous arrest scenarios. Furthermore, we discover subdiffusive behavior and demonstrate its close connection to the matrix structure.

We have prepared such low band gap polymers using the donor?acceptor route, which is based on the concept that the interaction between alternating donors and acceptors results in a compressed band gap. Furthermore, for application in photovoltaic devices, sufficient polymer solubility is required. We have prepared four low band gap conjugated polymers, with a bis(1-cyano-2-thienylvinylene)phenylene base structure, and achieved an excellent solubility by the introduction of long alkoxy and alkyl side chains. The polymers were synthesized via an oxidative polymerization. Their electronic properties were determined from electrochemical and optical measurements, which confirm that they indeed have a low band gap. In the blend of such a low band gap polymer with PCBM, evidence for efficient charge transfer was obtained from PL and EPR measurements. However, bulk heterostructure solar cells made of such blends display only low efficiencies, which is attributed to low charge carrier mobilities.},

	abstract = {The results of electronic structure calculations of the induced dipoles and quadrupoles on an anion in a locally distorted rocksalt crystal are described. Such information is of interest in the construction of ionic interaction potentials and for modeling the dielectric behavior of ionic materials. The systems included in the study are LiF, NaF, KF, LiCl, NaCl, KCl, LiBr, MgO and CaO. The results are used to characterize short-range contributions to the induced multipoles— those not included in a point-charge, point-polarizable ionic model (the “asymptotic” model). It is shown that these short-range effects are large, opposing and sometimes reversing the asymptotic contribution. The representation of the short-range effects in a computationally tractable form, suitable for use in computer simulations, is examined. A pairwise additive form, containing a steplike function of the interionic separation, is found to provide a good representation of the ab initio data for both dipoles and quadrupoles. Furthermore, the parameters involved in the fitted functions transfer from one material to another in a physically transparent and predictable way. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

In this work, we try to provide a direct and quantitative description of it. Within a three-dimensional density functional framework, the total excess free energy and individual energies at different two-phase interfaces are calculated during the droplet or bubble nucleation in binary fluids, and the line tension and contact angle are determined simultaneously. Meanwhile, the contact angle can also be measured directly from the spatial configuration of droplet or bubble. Comparing the calculated and measured contact angles, one can see that a good agreement is achieved for bubble and droplet at solvophilic and solvophobic walls. It is shown that line tension provides a considerable modification of contact angle prediction that is of great importance in engineering applications. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2013},

	isbn = {0-87339-478-X},
	abstract = {Strong coupling, as required by the differential aeration hypothesis, has been observed in stress corrosion cracking in a variety of systems, including IGSCC in sensitized Type 304 SS in simulated BWR coolant environments at 288 degreesC and in the caustic cracking of AISI 4340 steel at 70 degreesC. Coupling is manifest as a current flowing from the crack to the external surfaces, where it is consumed by the reduction of a cathodic depolarizer, such as oxygen, water, or hydrogen ion. Examination of this current, which is easily measured using a sensitive zero resistance ammeter, shows that it contains “structured” noise superimposed upon a mean. In the case of stainless steel in the high temperature aqueous environment, the mean current is found to be linearly related to the crack propagation rate and, indeed, the measurement of the coupling current may provide a sensitive method of measuring crack growth rate. Furthermore, the noise in the current is found to yield a wealth of information on the fracture events that occur at the crack tip, including their frequency, temporal relationship with other events, and size. This information has provided a clear view of the fracture mechanisms, which in both cases (IGSCC in stainless steel in BWR environments and caustic cracking in AISI 4340) appear to involve brittle micro fracture events of a few micrometers in size. These data are more consistent with hydrogen-induced fracture than they are with a slip/dissolution mechanism, even though the external environment is oxidizing in nature. Finally, the conservation of charge, as applied to the coupling current, provides the theoretical link between the properties of the crack internal and external environments that is necessary to estimate crack growth rate and hence the accumulated damage in a deterministic manner.},

We provide analytical connections between these functions. Excellent agreement with our simulation results is observed. We prove transition state theory rate constant to be identical to the inverse of the associated mean first passage time (hydrogen bond lifetime). Hence, the analysis establishes its Arrhenius temperature dependence. We give the explicit relation between reactive flux correlation function for the relaxation dynamics of hydrogen bonds, and their first passage time probability densities. All the different observations in the existing literature, associated with various estimates of hydrogen bonding times in liquid water that are affected (or not affected) by particular bond criteria, as well as by different definitions of hydrogen bond lifetimes applied in simulation, can be easily reconciled within the framework of reactive flux correlation function approach. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

They led to the 1998 Nobel Prize in chemistry. A DFT is illustrated here in its most simple and yet physically relevant form: the cDFT of an ideal fluid of classical particles. For illustration purposes, it is applied to the prediction of the molecular structure of liquid neon. The numerical experiment proposed therein is built around the writing of a cDFT code by students in Mathematica software. Students thus must deal with (i) the cDFT theory, (ii) some basic concepts of the statistical mechanics of simple fluids, (iii) functional minimization, and (iv) a useful functional programming language. This computational experiment is proposed during a molecular simulation class but may also be of interest in a quantum chemistry class to illustrate electronic DFT if the instruction highlights the analogies between quantum and classical DFTs.},

	abstract = {Smectite hydration strongly influences dynamical properties of interlayer cations and thus the fate of H2O and pollutants in surficial systems where smectite-based materials are often used as a major barrier component. Smectite crystal chemistry is known to rule its hydration, although the influence of specific parameters such as the amount and location of layer charge deficit remains poorly understood. A set of tetrahedrally charged trioctahedral smectites, with a common structural formula inter[Nax]oct[Mg6]tet[Si8.0?xAlx]O20(OH,F)4 and a layer charge (x) varying from 0.8 to 3.0, were thus synthesized to assess the influence of layer charge on smectite hydration and interlayer structure. Both hydroxylated and fluorinated samples were synthesized because of the increasing use of the latter varieties in recent spectroscopic studies aiming at the determination of interlayer H2O dynamical properties. The distribution of charge-compensating cations and of associated H2O molecules was determined both experimentally from the modeling of X-ray diffraction patterns and numerically from Monte Carlo molecular simulations performed in the grand canonical ensemble. The consistency of both approaches for hydroxylated samples allowed gaining insights into the specific influence of smectite crystal chemistry. For a given hydration state, H2O content is about constant in hydroxylated saponites, independent of layer charge, whereas smectite layer-to-layer distance decreases with increasing layer charge because of the enhanced cation-layer electrostatic attraction. As a result, positional disorder of interlayer H2O molecules is reduced because of stronger steric constraints and of the increased density of electronegative sites at the surface of the clay layer. Fluorine-for-hydroxyl isomorphic substitutions likely increase further electronegativity of the clay layer surface leading to further reduction of the interlayer H2O content and to the formation of Na+ inner sphere complexes at the clay layer surface. When normalized to the number of interlayer cations, the number of interlayer H2O molecules decreases with increasing layer charge, and the proportion of these H2O molecules hydrating interlayer cations increases, thus increasing the stability of most hydrated states toward lower relative humidity conditions. Smectite hydration evolution appears as a steady process with no tendency to interlayer cation ordering at the smectite-to-vermiculite limit of ?1.3 charge per O20(OH,F)4.},

The theory divides space into a cubic grid of cells. The side length of each cell is of the order of the bulk correlation length of the bulk liquid. Large length scale states of the cells are specified with an Ising variable. Finer length scale effects are described with a Gaussian field, with mean and variance affected by both the large length scale field and by the constraints imposed by solutes. In the absence of solutes and corresponding constraints, integration over the Gaussian field yields an effective lattice-gas Hamiltonian for the large length scale field. In the presence of solutes, the integration adds additional terms to this Hamiltonian. We identify these terms analytically. They can provoke large length scale effects, such as the formation of interfaces and depletion layers. We apply our theory to compute the reversible work to form a bubble in liquid water, as a function of the bubble radius. Comparison with molecular simulation results for the same function indicates that the theory is reasonably accurate. Importantly, simulating the large length scale field involves binary arithmetic only. It thus provides a computationally convenient scheme to incorporate explicit solvent dynamics and structure in simulation studies of large molecular assemblies.},

To elucidate the role of three-body interactions on the thermodynamic properties of the studied mixtures, we have incorporated Wang and Sadus method into MD simulations performed using density-dependent two-body HFD-like potentials.

Much better results for pressure have been obtained at high densities using the effective LJ potential. For the second virial coefficient, the HFD-like potential is a better choice.

	abstract = {Transport coefficients, the elements of the so-called Onsager matrix, are essential quantities for modeling solid-state kinetics controlled by diffusion. In a face-centered-cubic structure, drag of solute atoms by vacancies can be caused by solute-vacancy binding at nearest neighbors. In order to investigate solute drag in alloys with interactions up to the third-nearest-neighbor sites, we extend an analytic method: the self-consistent mean field method. With this method, we calculate the Onsager matrix of model alloys to identify kinetic effects arising from individual and collective jump frequencies and assess the results on select cases using atomic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Using preexisting density functional theory data from various sources, we show that many impurities have low-temperature solute drag before changing to solute exchange at high temperatures. We evaluate the transition temperature for these alloys between these two regimes and compare the results with available experimental data. Some disagreement is found, which can be due both to experimental and numerical shortcomings. In order to guide diffusion calculations, the sensitivity of the Onsager matrix to the range of the kinetic correlation and to the input density functional theory data is studied.},

	abstract = {The analysis of salt transport in nanofiltration using extended Nernst?Planck equations or similar models often suffers from the difficulties to establish and independently and transparently verify the consistency between the filtration results, assumed mechanism, and fitted values of parameters. As a general alternative, we propose here a procedure that reduces filtration data to two general phenomenological coefficients, concentration-dependent salt permeability ?s and Pecle?t coefficient A, which does not require that a specific exclusion mechanism be assumed and thus allows a transparent test on consistency with commonly used models. This approach was demonstrated using concentration polarization-corrected filtration data for NF-200 membrane and four monovalent salts, NaCl, NaBr, KBr, and KCl. The coefficient A was found to be very small, which points to the negligible contribution of convection to salt transport. The smallness of A was verified through estimates of the effective pore radius of the membrane, found to be between 0.2 and 0.3 nm, and comparing them with similar independent estimates from the hydraulic permeability Lp using the data on the thickness and swelling of the selective polyamide layer obtained by AFM. The concentration dependence of ?s and its variation for different salts suggested that in the concentration range above 0.01 M the salt exclusion may be dominated by a combination of Donnan and dielectric mechanisms. The values of ?s obtained for single salts were also consistent with the selectivity observed for equimolar feed mixtures of NaCl and NaBr. However, the observed variation of ?s with concentrations of single salts below 0.01 M reveals a new regime that is inconsistent with all commonly used models of NF based on a Donnan mechanism modified with dielectric and steric effects. In particular, ?s appeared to approach a constant value at low salt concentrations, whereas the standard mechanisms predict a linear or even steeper decrease as concentration decreases. This puzzling discrepancy could have passed unnoticed in the standard multiparameter fitting extended Nernst?Planck equations and demonstrates the benefits of the present phenomenological analysis.},

Interest centers on the nontrivial concentration dependence exhibited by these transport coefficients, which agrees well with that observed experimentally, and in relating this to the strength of the association between an ion and its first coordination shell. The relationships between the various transport coefficients, such as those between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity (Stokes–Einstein) and the conductivity (Nernst–Einstein) also exhibit composition dependences that reflect this association. The connection between the internal mobility and two measures of the coordination shell dynamics (the cage relaxation time and the self-exchange velocity) is explored; it is shown that the self-exchange velocity follows the composition and temperature dependence of the internal mobility very well. Finally, it is shown that allowing for anion polarization in the interaction model increases the mobility of all species without changing the structure of the melt discernibly, with the largest effect being found for the Li+ ion. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

In both relaxation processes, a power law frequency dependence is observed. Based upon fluctuation–dissipation arguments, the power law exponents should be equivalent. However, experimentally, it appears that the conductivity exponent is generally smaller than the NSR exponent. While an explanation for this discrepancy based upon fundamental differences in the correlation functions probed by the two techniques has been proffered, we show how this discrepancy may simply arise from differing analyses of the ac conductivity. We review several cases taken from the literature in which the conductivity exponent was obtained from analysis of the electrical modulus. We demonstrate how this analysis approach generally underestimates the conductivity exponent. When we instead determine the exponent directly from the ac conductivity, we find near equivalence between the NSR and ECR exponents. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

We find the MFPT as a function of the fraction of the boundary occupied by the arcs (i) for n evenly spaced arcs and (ii) for two arcs arbitrarily located on the boundary. As the arc length tends to zero, our approximate solution reduces to the known asymptotic formula for the MFPT rigorously derived in studies devoted of the narrow escape problem.},

	abstract = {A theoretical analysis of the three currently popular microscopic theories of solvation dynamics, namely, the dynamic mean spherical approximation (DMSA), the molecular hydrodynamic theory (MHT), and the memory function theory (MFT) is carried out. It is shown that in the underdamped limit of momentum relaxation, all three theories lead to nearly identical results when the translational motions of both the solute ion and the solvent molecules are neglected. In this limit, the theoretical prediction is in almost perfect agreement with the computer simulation results of solvation dynamics in the model Stockmayer liquid. However, the situation changes significantly in the presence of the translational motion of the solvent molecules. In this case, DMSA breaks down but the other two theories correctly predict the acceleration of solvation in agreement with the simulation results. We find that the translational motion of a light solute ion can play an important role in its own solvation. None of the existing theories describe this aspect. A generalization of the extended hydrodynamic theory is presented which, for the first time, includes the contribution of solute motion towards its own solvation dynamics. The extended theory gives excellent agreement with the simulations where solute motion is allowed. It is further shown that in the absence of translation, the memory function theory of Fried and Mukamel can be recovered from the hydrodynamic equations if the wave vector dependent dissipative kernel in the hydrodynamic description is replaced by its long wavelength value. We suggest a convenient memory kernel which is superior to the limiting forms used in earlier descriptions. We also present an alternate, quite general, statistical mechanical expression for the time dependent solvation energy of an ion. This expression has remarkable similarity with that for the translational dielectric friction on a moving ion.},

This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of S ̂ 2 , and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

The ability of Na(+) to disrupt the native tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules, and of Cl(-) to integrate within this organization, is preserved in this mW-ion model through parametrization focused on water's solvation of these ions. This model successfully reproduces the structural effect of ions on water, referenced to observations from experiments and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, while using extremely short-ranged potentials. Without Coulomb interactions the model replicates details of the ion-water structure such as distinguishing contact and solvent-separated ion pairs and the free energy barriers between them. The approach of mimicking ionic effects with short-ranged interactions results in performance gains of two orders of magnitude compared to Ewald methods. Explored over a broad range of salt concentration, the model reproduces the solvation structure and trends of diffusion relative to atomistic simulations and experimental results. The functional form of the mW-ion model can be parametrized to represent other electrolytes. With increased computational efficiency and reliable structural fidelity, this model promises to be an asset for accessing significantly longer simulation time scales with an explicit solvent in a coarse-grained system involving, for example, polyelectrolytes such as proteins, nucleic acids, and fuel-cell membranes.},

By definition, nanofluidics explores transport phenomena of fluids at nanometer scales. Why is the nanometer scale specific? What fluid properties are probed at nanometric scales? In other words, why does ‘nanofluidics’ deserve its own brand name? In this critical review, we will explore the vast manifold of length scales emerging for fluid behavior at the nanoscale, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications. We will in particular explore the interplay between bulk and interface phenomena. The limit of validity of the continuum approaches will be discussed, as well as the numerous surface induced effects occurring at these scales, from hydrodynamic slippage to the various electro-kinetic phenomena originating from the couplings between hydrodynamics and electrostatics. An enlightening analogy between ion transport in nanochannels and transport in doped semi-conductors will be discussed (156 references).},

The energy of Tii4+ at other sites is somewhat higher than this figure, and allowed the migration energy of Tii4+ parallel to the c axis to be estimated as 2.9 eV. The formation energy of Vo2+ was found to be 10.1eV. The variation of these formation energies with dielectric constant was also calculated. It was found that the energy of formation of Tii4+ varied considerably with dielectric constant, while the formation energy of Vo2+ was almost independent of dielectric constant. The relevance of these results to the presence of crystallographic shear planes in reduced rutile is considered.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of problems involving molecular motion in liquids can be formulated in terms of the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). The friction coefficient on a molecular bond or on some more complicated reaction coordinate is then required. An often used approximation is to set the dynamic friction constant equal to the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating force exerted on the frozen bond by the remaining unfrozen coordinates. The true friction involves projection operators and should differ from this approximation. In this paper we derive various identities and show that the rigid bond approximation is the high frequency limit of the true dynamic friction coefficient. We compute the ‘‘true’’ dynamic friction and the friction approximated on the basis of the rigid or frozen bond and show that the asymptotic limit is very accurate even for frequencies not much larger than the peak frequency of the solvent spectral density. Two different dynamical systems are studied using MD simulations with our newly devised NAPA integrator for systems with disparate time scales. In one the molecule is not allowed to rotate and in the other it is allowed to rotate. Interestingly, even for very long rotational reorientation times, small but significant differences in the long time decay of the bond dynamic friction are observed for rotational and nonrotational molecules—differences, however, that do not produce large differences in the static friction constants.},

We demonstrate these methods with three different capacitors: pure water between platinum electrodes and a pure as well as a solvent-based organic electrolyte each between graphite electrodes. The total charge distributions with the pure solvent and solvent-based electrolytes are remarkably Gaussian, while in the pure ionic liquid the total charge distribution displays distinct non-Gaussian features, suggesting significant potential-driven changes in the organization of the interfacial fluid.},

Compared to a fully stochastic method, the semistochastic approach significantly reduces the computational time required to obtain the eigenvalue to a specified statistical uncertainty. This is demonstrated by the application of the semistochastic quantum Monte Carlo method to systems with a sign problem: the fermion Hubbard model and the carbon dimer.},

The QSH state was predicted and experimentally demonstrated to be realized in HgTe quantum wells. The existence of the edge channels has been inferred from local and non-local transport measurements in sufficiently small devices. Here we directly confirm the existence of the edge channels by imaging the magnetic fields produced by current flowing in large Hall bars made from HgTe quantum wells. These images distinguish between current that passes through each edge and the bulk. On tuning the bulk conductivity by gating or raising the temperature, we observe a regime in which the edge channels clearly coexist with the conducting bulk, providing input to the question of how ballistic transport may be limited in the edge channels. Our results represent a versatile method for characterization of new QSH materials systems.},

	abstract = {We present a theory of nuclear-spin relaxation appropriate to the case of a mobile liquid dipolar spin diffusing in a quasi-two-dimensional model porous system in the presence of rare paramagnetic impurities fixed at the surface of the pores. This theory predicts that the 1H spin-lattice relaxation rate will be linear in two parts when plotted as a function of the logarithm of the magnetic-field strength and the slopes of these distinct linear regions should be in the ratio 10:3. The theory predicts also a typical pore size dependence for such a rate. The theory is tested at several temperatures using acetone, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide on microporous chromatographic glass beads that have paramagnetic ion impurities at the level of 40 ppm. 1H spin-lattice relaxation rates are recorded over magnetic-field strengths corresponding to 1H Larmor frequencies between 0.01 and 30 MHz using a field-switched magnetic relaxation dispersion spectrometer. The data support the theory quantitatively. The diffusion constant DI⊥ for the proton-bearing molecule perpendicular to the normal of the pore surface is found to be nearly a factor of 10 smaller than in the bulk solvents. It is characterized by a small activation energy similar to those in the bulk solvent. These results demonstrate that magnetic relaxation dispersion at low magnetic-field strengths in high-surface-area heterogeneous systems may be quantitatively understood in terms of the parameters of the spatial confinement and the local translational dynamics.},

	abstract = {Embedding protein in sugar systems of low water content enables one to investigate the protein dynamic-structure function in matrixes whose rigidity is modulated by varying the content of residual water. Accordingly, studying the dynamics and structure thermal evolution of a protein in sugar systems of different hydration constitutes a tool for disentangling solvent rigidity from temperature effects. Furthermore, studies performed using different sugars may give information on how the detailed composition of the surrounding solvent affects the internal protein dynamics and structural evolution. In this work, we compare Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements (300-20 K) on MbCO embedded in trehalose, sucrose, maltose, raffinose, and glucose matrixes of different water content. At all the water contents investigated, the protein-solvent coupling was tighter in trehalose than in the other sugars, thus suggesting a molecular basis for the trehalose peculiarity. These results are in line with the observation that protein-matrix phase separation takes place in lysozyme-lactose, whereas it is absent in lysozyme-trehalose systems; indeed, these behaviors may respectively be due to the lack or presence of suitable water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks, which match the protein surface to the surroundings. The above processes might be at the basis of pattern recognition in crowded living systems; indeed, hydration shells structural and dynamic matching is first needed for successful come together of interacting biomolecules.},

The eutectic temperature of the quaternary salt mixture was predicted to be 371.75 K. The quaternary eutectic mixture was synthesized based on the predicted eutectic composition and the eutectic temperature was determined using the Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The experimental melting point was 372.17 K which was in excellent agreement with that of the predicted value. The heat capacity of the eutectic mixture was determined by the DSC as function of temperature in the liquid state and heat capacity increased with increase in temperature. Density of the molten quaternary eutectic mixture decreases linearly with increase in temperature. Thermal stability of the eutectic mixture was determined by both short-term and long-term thermogravimetric analyses. Short-term thermal stability test showed negligible weight loss. However, 7.4 wt.\% weight loss was observed in the long–term thermal stability test at 773.15 K which corresponds to thermal decomposition of the salt mixture. Upper temperature limit for long-term thermal stability of the eutectic mixture was determined to be 703.15 K. Thermal energy storage capacity of the novel eutectic mixture was found to be larger than that of conventional solar salt and HITEC® salt.},

The use of pair-additivity results in substantial computer time savings in the quantum chemical calculation of the electric field gradients for nuclei in liquid systems using the so-called cluster approach, and hence their quadrupole coupling constants. It also permits the simulation of quadrupolar relaxation times from electric field gradient hypersurfaces obtained within the pair-additive approximation.},

	abstract = {Systematic computational work for a series of 13 disaccharides was performed to provide an atomic-level insight of unique biochemical role of the alpha,alpha-(1--{\textgreater}1)-linked glucopyranoside dimer over the other glycosidically linked sugars. Superior osmotic and cryoprotective abilities of trehalose were explained on the basis of conformational and hydration characteristics of the trehalose molecule. Analyses of the hydration number and radial distribution function of solvent water molecules showed that there was very little hydration adjacent to the glycosidic oxygen of trehalose and that the dynamic conformation of trehalose was less flexible than any of the other sugars due to this anisotropic hydration. The remarkable conformational rigidity that allowed trehalose to act as a sugar template was required for stable interactions with hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Trehalose made an average of 2.8 long-lived hydrogen bonds per each MD step, which was much larger than the average of 2.1 for the other sugars. The stable hydrogen-bond network is derived from the formation of long-lived water bridges at the expense of decreasing the dynamics of the water molecules. Evidence for this dynamic reduction of water by trehalose was also established based on each of the lowest translational diffusion coefficients and the lowest intermolecular coulombic energy of the water molecules around trehalose. Overall results indicate that trehalose functions as a 'dynamic reducer' for solvent water molecules based on its anisotropic hydration and conformational rigidity, suggesting that macroscopic solvent properties could be modulated by changes in the type of glycosidic linkages in sugar molecules.},

Nonequilibrium cosegregation (surface nucleated precipitation) of Cr and C leads to formation of a CrC surface compound with a structure related to cubic rocksalt. Such a phase does not exist in the bulk, but is stabilized by epitaxy to the bcc(100) surface. The formation of this surface compound (with C content between 1.6 and 2.4 ML) can be viewed as a structural transformation comparable to a giant expansion (≈46\%) between the first two metal layers of the alloy surface. Details of the surface composition and structure have been obtained on a layer-by-layer basis. C atoms in the first two layers are found to be buckled towards the vacuum by ≈0.2 Å, characteristic of ionic bonding in which the anion has the higher polarizability. It is suggested that changes in the subsurface carbon concentration could allow for the controlled engineering of thin-film characteristics, such as magnetic properties, by modification of near-surface interlayer spacings.},

However, as shown by Kastenholz and Hünenberger [J. Chem. Phys.124, 224501 (2006)]10.1529/biophysj.106.083667, correction terms can be derived for the effects of: (A) an incorrect solvent polarization around the ion and an incomplete or/and inexact interaction of the ion with the polarized solvent due to the use of an approximate (not strictly Coulombic) electrostatic scheme; (B) the finite-size or artificial periodicity of the simulated system; (C) an improper summation scheme to evaluate the potential at the ion site, and the possible presence of a polarized air–liquid interface or of a constraint of vanishing average electrostatic potential in the simulated system; and (D) an inaccurate dielectric permittivity of the employed solvent model. Comparison with standard experimental data also requires the inclusion of appropriate cavity-formation and standard-state correction terms. In the present study, this correction scheme is extended by: (i) providing simple approximate analytical expressions (empirically-fitted) for the correction terms that were evaluated numerically in the above scheme (continuum-electrostatics calculations); (ii) providing correction terms for derivative thermodynamic single-ion solvation properties (and corresponding partial molar variables in solution), namely, the enthalpy,entropy, isobaric heat capacity, volume, isothermal compressibility, and isobaric expansivity (including appropriate standard-state correction terms). The ability of the correction scheme to produce methodology-independent single-ion solvation free energies based on atomistic simulations is tested in the case of Na+ hydration, and the nature and magnitude of the correction terms for derivative thermodynamic properties is assessed numerically.},

While diffraction methods such as x ray are widely used to study the internal pore space, these methods suffer from the loss of the phase information in the detected signals. Recently, an advanced diffusive diffraction NMR method was proposed [ F. B. Laun et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 048102 (2011)] which is predicted to preserve the phase information, thus overcoming this severe limitation of diffraction methods in general. Here we provide experimental confirmation that the suggested approach is indeed able to acquire the diffractive signal including its phase which allows the direct image reconstruction of the pore space, averaged over all pores. We furthermore prove that this approach may combine the advantages of magnetic resonance imaging, namely, its robust and straightforward image reconstruction via a Fourier transformation with the much improved spatial resolution of pulsed gradient spin echo NMR.},

The spin?lattice relaxation rates are extracted numerically from the relaxation simulations. The rates obtained from the numerical fitting of the relaxation curves are compared to those obtained by direct simulation from the relaxation Bloch?Wangsness?Abragam?Redfield theory (BWART). We have restricted our study to anisotropic rigid-body rotational processes, and to the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and a single spin?spin dipolar (END) coupling mechanisms. Examples using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) nitroxide and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) deuterium quadrupolar systems are provided. The objective is to compare those rates obtained by numerical simulations with the rates obtained by BWART. There is excellent agreement between the simulated and BWART rates for a Hamiltonian describing a single spin (an electron) interacting with the bath through the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) mechanism undergoing anisotropic rotational diffusion. In contrast, when the Hamiltonian contains both the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and the spin?spin dipolar (END) mechanisms, the decay rate of a single exponential fit of the simulated spin?lattice relaxation rate is up to a factor of 0.2 smaller than that predicted by BWART. When the relaxation curves are fit to a double exponential, the slow and fast rates extracted from the decay curves bound the BWART prediction. An extended BWART theory, in the literature, includes the need for multiple relaxation rates and indicates that the multiexponential decay is due to the combined effects of direct and cross-relaxation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In this work, we show how increasing the charge of small cations affects the structural, thermodynamical, and dynamical properties of these ions in liquid water. We have studied the case of lanthanoid and actinoid ions, for which we have recently developed accurate polarizable force fields, and the ionic radius is in the 0.995–1.250 Å range, and explored the valency range from 0 to 4+. We found that the ion charge strongly structures the neighboring water molecules and that, in this range of charges, the hydration enthalpies exhibit a quadratic dependence with respect to the charge, in line with the Born model. The diffusion process follows two main regimes: a hydrodynamical regime for neutral or low charges, and a dielectric friction regime for high charges in which the contraction of the ionic radius along the series of elements causes a decrease of the diffusion coefficient. This latter behavior can be qualitatively described by theoretical models, such as the Zwanzig and the solvated ion models. However, these models need be modified in order to obtain agreement with the observed behavior in the full charge range. We have thus modified the solvated ion model by introducing a dependence of the bare ion radius as a function of the ionic charge. Besides agreement between theory and simulation this modification allows one to obtain an empirical unified model. Thus, by analyzing the contributions to the drag coefficient from the viscous and the dielectric terms, we are able to explain the transition from a regime in which the effect of viscosity dominates to one in which dielectric friction governs the motion of ions with radii of ca. 1 Å.},

This formula only requires the pair correlation functions for one single state of the system, and applies to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fluids. The coupling parameter integration method to calculate the chemical potential—where one particle is gradually coupled to the rest—is also investigated. It is shown that the μ value obtained in the approximate theories is not unique, but depends on the integration path. This behavior is due to inconsistencies of the approximation, which are discussed in some detail. For a certain choice of integration path the μ values obtained using the latter method agree with those from the explicit formula. Numerical results for the different closures are presented for a hard sphere fluid. The accuracy of μ depends strongly on the quality of the bridge function inside the hard core diameter.},

In order to demonstrate the straightforward extensibility of LBM, we then focus on an application in material science involving fluid flows with free surfaces.

This method allows resolution of solute-solvent interfaces and realization of excluded volumes of particles in the presence of hydrodynamic coupling. With these capabilities, we show that the ubiquitous forces mediated by the solvent, hydrophobicity and hydrodynamics, can be linked in a mesoscopic simulation. The strategies we devise to overcome the numerical issues of mixing variables in the Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinate systems, i.e., using a pair of auxiliary fluids to realize the excluded volumes of particles and assigning collocating gridding systems on solutes to interface with solvent fields, are also presented. Simulation results show that the hybrid FHD and MD method can reproduce the solvation free energies and scaling laws of particles dynamics for hydrophobes of different sizes. The collapse of two hydrophobic particles was also simulated to illustrate that the hybrid FHD and MD method has the potential to be generally applied to study nanoscale self-assembly and dynamics-structure-function relationships of biomolecules.},

The results suggest a way of reconciling the conclusions of Raman studies about the structures of the melts with those of neutron and x-ray-diffraction studies, which have already been examined with the same simulation methods. The Raman spectra, both polarized and depolarized, are calculated from a model for the dependence of the polarizability of the system on the ionic coordinates which was inspired by electronic structure calculations of the polarizabilities of ions in a condensed phase environment.

	abstract = {A benchmark theoretical study of the electronic ground state and of the vertical and adiabatic singlet-triplet (ST) excitation energies of benzene ( n = 1 ) and n -acenes ( C 4 n + 2 H 2 n + 4 ) ranging from naphthalene ( n = 2 ) to heptacene ( n = 7 ) is presented, on the ground of single- and multireference calculations based on restricted or unrestricted zero-order wave functions. High-level and large scale treatments of electronic correlation in the ground state are found to be necessary for compensating giant but unphysical symmetry-breaking effects in unrestricted single-reference treatments. The composition of multiconfigurational wave functions, the topologies of natural orbitals in symmetry-unrestricted CASSCF calculations, the T1 diagnostics of coupled cluster theory, and further energy-based criteria demonstrate that all investigated systems exhibit a A 1 g singlet closed-shell electronic ground state. Singlet-triplet ( S 0 -T 1 ) energy gaps can therefore be very accurately determined by applying the principles of a focal point analysis onto the results of a series of single-point and symmetry-restricted calculations employing correlation consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets ( X = D , T, Q, 5) and single-reference methods [HF, MP2, MP3, MP4SDQ, CCSD, CCSD(T)] of improving quality. According to our best estimates, which amount to a dual extrapolation of energy differences to the level of coupled cluster theory including single, double, and perturbative estimates of connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)] in the limit of an asymptotically complete basis set ( cc-pV ∞ Z ) , the S 0 -T 1 vertical excitation energies of benzene ( n = 1 ) and n -acenes ( n = 2 – 7 ) amount to 100.79, 76.28, 56.97, 40.69, 31.51, 22.96, and 18.16 kcal/mol, respectively. Values of 87.02, 62.87, 46.22, 32.23, 24.19, 16.79, and 12.56 kcal/mol are correspondingly obtained at the CCSD ( T ) / cc-pV ∞ Z level for the S 0 -T 1 adiabatic excitation energies, upon including B3LYP/cc-PVTZ corrections for zero-point vibrational energies. In line with the absence of Peierls distortions, extrapolations of results indicate a vanishingly small S 0 -T 1 energy gap of 0 to ∼ 4 kcal / mol ( ∼ 0.17 eV ) in the limit of an infinitely large polyacene.},

Our understanding of these complex processes at the atomic level is provided by a few experimental and analytical methods such as X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopies. However, due to complexities in the structure and composition of clay and other hydrated minerals, and the inherent uncertainties of the experimental methods, it is important to apply theoretical molecular models for a fundamental atomic-level understanding, interpretation, and prediction of these phenomena. In this effort, we have developed a general force field, CLAYFF, suitable for the simulation of hydrated and multicomponent mineral systems and their interfaces with aqueous solutions. Interatomic potentials were derived from parametrizations incorporating structural and spectroscopic data for a variety of simple hydrated compounds. A flexible SPC-based water model is used to describe the water and hydroxyl behavior. Metal?oxygen interactions are described by a Lennard-Jones function and a Coulombic term with partial charges derived by Mulliken and ESP analysis of DFT results. Bulk structures, relaxed surface structures, and intercalation processes are evaluated and compared to experimental and spectroscopic findings for validation. Our approach differs from most others in that we treat most interatomic interactions as nonbonded. This allows us to effectively use the force field for a wide variety of phases and to properly account for energy and momentum transfer between the fluid phase and the solid, while keeping the number of parameters small enough to allow modeling of relatively large and highly disordered systems. Simulations of clay, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide phases and their interfaces with aqueous solutions combine energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods to describe the structure and behavior of water, hydroxyl, surface species, and intercalates in these systems. The results obtained to date demonstrate that CLAYFF shows good promise to evolve into a widely adaptable and broadly effective force field for molecular simulations of fluid interfaces with clays and other clay-related phases, as well as other inorganic materials characterized by complex, disordered, and often ill-determined structure and composition.},

The P-cluster is believed to mediate the electron transfer between the Fe protein and the MoFe protein via interconversions between its various oxidation states, such as the all-ferrous state (PN) and the one- (P+) and two-electron (P2+) oxidized states. While the structural and electronic properties of PN and P2+ states have been well characterized, little is known about the electronic structure of the P+ state. Here, a mutant strain of Azotobacter vinelandii (DJ1193) was used to facilitate the characterization of the P+ state of P-cluster. This strain expresses a MoFe protein variant (designated ?nifB ?-188Cys MoFe protein) that accumulates the P+ form of P-cluster in the resting state. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectrum of the P-cluster in the oxidized ?nifB ?-188Cys MoFe protein closely resembles that of the P2+ state in the oxidized wild-type MoFe protein, except for the absence of a major charge-transfer band centered at 823 nm. Moreover, magnetization curves of ?nifB ?-188Cys and wild-type MoFe proteins suggest that the P2+ species in both proteins have the same spin state. MCD spectrum of the P+ state in the ?nifB ?-188Cys MoFe protein, on the other hand, is associated with a classic [Fe4S4]+ cluster, suggesting that the P-cluster could be viewed as two coupled 4Fe clusters and that it could donate either one or two electrons to FeMoco by using one or both of its 4Fe halves. Such a mode of action of P-cluster could provide energetic and kinetic advantages to nitrogenase in the complex mechanism of N2 reduction.},

Models derived from three 1.6 Å resolution X-ray data sets are described; two represent distinct oxidation states, whilst the third appears to be a mixture of both oxidized and reduced states (or perhaps an intermediate state). The structures of the protein and the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) appear to be largely unaffected by the redox status, although the movement of Ser β90 and a surface helix in the β subunit may be of functional significance. By contrast, the 8Fe-7S P-cluster undergoes discrete conformational changes involving the movement of two iron atoms.

Comparisons with known component 1 structures reveal subtle differences in the FeMoco environment, which could account for the lower midpoint potential of this cluster in Kp1. Furthermore, a non-proline-cis peptide bond has been identified in the α subunit that may have a functional role. It is within 10 Å of the FeMoco and may have been overlooked in other component 1 models. Finally, metal-metal and metal-sulphur distances within the metal clusters agree well with values derived from EXAFS studies, although they are generally longer than the values reported for the closely related protein from Azotobacter vinelandii. A number of bonds between the clusters and their ligands are distinctly longer than the EXAFS values, in particular, those involving the molybdenum atom of the FeMoco.},

P.; Laasonen, K.; Laaksonen, A. J. Chem. Phys. 2001, 114, 3120], as well as earlier potentials of Lennard-Jones type with two widely different sets of parameters [Dang, L. X.; J. Chem. Phys. 1992, 96, 6970 and Heinzinger, K.; Physica B 1985, 131, 196]. Hydration structure and residence times around Li+ are studied with focus on the still somewhat controversial issue of hydration structure:? both tetrahedral and octahedral water coordination have been predicted from the experiments. Besides classical MD simulations, even complementary Car?Parrinello simulations were employed to investigate the stability of a possible six-coordinated hydration shell around lithium. Self-diffusion coefficients for lithium were calculated for Li+ from the simulations and compared to NMR spin?echo measurements. The new ab initio-based exponential Li+?H2O interaction potential appears to be robust giving the overall characteristic hydration properties in agreement with experiments. However, while it reproduces the radial distribution function (RDF) features from a recent neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution (NDIS) experiments with a well-pronounced tetrahedral water structure, the same experiment is interpreted to give octahedral water structure around lithium at the same concentrations and temperatures as were used in our simulations.},

	abstract = {Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the interaction of stabilizing carbohydrates with dried proteins. Freeze-drying of trehalose, lactose, and myo-inositol with lysozyme resulted in substantial alterations of the infrared spectra of the dried carbohydrates. In the fingerprint region (900-1500 cm-1), there were large shifts in the frequencies of bands, a decrease in absorbance, and a loss of band splitting. These effects mimic those of water on hydrated trehalose. Bands assigned to hydroxyl stretching modes (around 3350 cm-1) were decreased in intensity and shifted to higher frequencies in the presence of the protein. In complementary experiments, it was found that dehydration-induced shifts in the positions of amide I and amide II bands for lysozyme could be partially and fully reversed, respectively, when the protein was freeze-dried in the presence of either trehalose or lactose. In addition, the carboxylate band, which was not detectable in the protein dried without the sugar, was apparent when these sugars were present. myo-Inositol was less effective at shifting the amide bands, and the carboxylate band was not detected in the presence of this carbohydrate. Also tested was the concentration dependency of the carbohydrates' influence on the position of the amide II band for dried lysozyme. The results showed that the ability of a given concentration of a carbohydrate to shift this band back toward the position noted with the hydrated protein coincided, at least in the extreme cases, with the capacity of that same level of carbohydrate to preserve the activity of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase during freeze-drying.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Phys. 139, 134109 (2013)], we investigate the concentration dependence of conduction-diffusion linear transport properties for a symmetric binary electrolyte solution. The ions are treated in this method as charged Brownian spheres, and the solvent-mediated ion-ion hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for also in the ion atmosphere relaxation effect. By means of a simplified solution scheme, convenient semi-analytic MCT expressions are derived for the electrophoretic mobilities, and the molar conductivity, of an electrolyte mixture with equal-sized ions. These expressions reduce to the classical Debye-Falkenhagen-Onsager-Fuoss results in the limit of very low ion concentration. The MCT expressions are numerically evaluated for a binary electrolyte, and compared to experimental data and results by another theoretical method. Our analysis encloses, in addition, the electrolyte viscosity. To analyze the dynamic influence of the hydration shell, the significance of mixed slip-stick hydrodynamic surface boundary conditions, and the effect of solvent permeability are explored. For the stick boundary condition employed in the hydrodynamic diffusivity tensors, our theoretical results for the molar conductivity and viscosity of an aqueous 1:1 electrolyte are in good overall agreement with reported experimental data for aqueous NaCl solutions, for concentrations extending even up to two molar.},

When the channel walls are smooth, the translocation times of linear and branched polymers with the same monomer number are very similar. However, for walls that are decorated with attractive patches, dramatic differences show up: whereas a dendrimer successively docks at the patches and "walks" from one to the next, being carried away by the solvent flow, linear chains spread themselves along the channel wall without achieving translocation within simulation times. Our findings are relevant for, e.g., drug delivery through dendritic carrier molecules in capillary arterioles.},

This is in agreement with results from a generalized hydrodynamic theory that includes the angular momentum of rotating dipolar molecules.

	abstract = {The relaxation properties of hydration water around fructose, glucose, sucrose, and trehalose molecules have been studied by means of extended frequency range depolarized light scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. Evidence is given of hydration dynamics retarded by a factor ξ = 5-6 for all the analyzed solutes. A dynamical hydration shell is defined based on the solute-induced slowing down of water mobility at picosecond time scales. The number of dynamically perturbed water molecules N(h) and its concentration dependence have been determined in glucose and trehalose aqueous solutions up to high solute weight fractions (ca. 45\%). For highly dilute solutions, about 3.3 water molecules per sugar hydroxyl group are found to be part of the hydration shell of mono- and disaccharide. For increasing concentrations, a noticeable solute-dependent reduction of hydration number occurs, which has been attributed, in addition to simple statistical shells overlapping, to aggregation of solute molecules. A scaling law based on the number of hydroxyl groups collapses the N(h) concentration dependence of glucose and trehalose into a single master plot, suggesting hydration and aggregation properties independent of the size of the sugar. As a whole, the present results point to the concentration of hydroxyl groups as the parameter guiding both sugar-water and sugar-sugar interactions, without appreciable difference between mono- and disaccharides.},

We find that the presence of trehalose causes global retardation of the dynamics of water. Comparing aqueous solutions of lysozyme with/without trehalose, we observe that the dynamics of water in the hydration layers close to the protein is dramatically slower when trehalose is present in the system. We also analyze the structure of water and trehalose around the lysozyme and find that the trehalose molecules form a cage surrounding the protein that contains very slow water molecules. We conclude that the transient cage of trehalose molecules that entraps and slows the water molecules prevents the crystallisation of protein hydration water upon cooling.},

An LBGK method is used to calculate flow in several geometries of increasing complexity, using a first-order accurate and two nominally second-order-accurate methods for no-slip boundaries. The geometries include uniform flow past an isolated sphere, quadratic flow past a sphere near a wall, flow through a BCC array of spheres, and through a randomly packed bed of spheres. The packed bed flows are also used to compare hydrodynamic dispersion results. The results confirm second-order-accurate behavior where Navier–Stokes flows are clearly developed. However 3D pore-scale simulations involve a trade-off between resolution of the flow and the number of pore spaces, and there is a resolution threshold, below which certain flow features, such as recirculation, are not resolved. We conjecture that most simulations will tend to operate near this threshold because of the competing demands for resolution and statistical accuracy. We consider local flow features and the velocity distribution, in addition to hydraulic permeability and drag, to provide a fuller understanding of accuracy near this threshold.},

In the monolayer regime, three different adsorbed amounts corresponding to increasing fillings of the interlayer space were investigated whereas two situations (adsorption and desorption) were investigated in the bilayer region. In a first step, molecular dynamics were used to reexamine some of the approximations classically used in the analysis of water motion by QENS (i.e., separation between rotational and translational diffusion, preferred orientation of molecules, and contribution to the elastic incoherent structure factor). A careful analysis of experimental data obtained at two wavelengths and for two orientations of the clay platelets and validated by simulations yielded rotational and translational movements of water molecules in the clay interlayer. Two rotational movements at two different time scales are revealed. The faster one is rather independent of the adsorbed water amount whereas the slower one assigned to the rotation of hydrated cations is significantly slowed down in the monolayer regime, especially upon completion of the first water layer. Translational movements are limited in the longitudinal direction and are significantly slower than in bulk water in the radial direction, even in the bilayer regime.},

Among those systems the acidic 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium fluoride (EMIF·2.3HF) has been widely studied experimentally since it is the more promising for electrochemical applications. Recent studies (Hagiwara et al. J. Electrochem. Soc. 2002, 149, D1), while yielding many results, raised some questions about structural features of the liquid:? absence of hydrogen bonds between the EMI+ ring hydrogen atoms and the fluoride anions, persistence of stacks and layers of cations similar to those existing in the crystal, and interpretation of the X-ray diffraction spectra. To address these questions, we have developed a simple molecular dynamics model. Our simulations are very consistent with experimental results and complete them, providing an atomic scale interpretation.},

To date, methods that quantify the 3D morphology on length scales ranging from a few tens of nanometers to several hundred nanometers have had limited success. We demonstrate, for the first time, that it is possible to go beyond visualization and to extract quantitative morphological information from X-ray images in the aforementioned length scales. As examples, two different hierarchical geomaterials exhibiting complex porous structures ranging from nanometer to macroscopic scale are studied: a flocculated clay water suspension and two hydrated cement pastes. We show that from a single projection image it is possible to perform a direct computation of the ultra-small angle-scattering spectra. The predictions matched very well the experimental data obtained by the best ultra-small angle-scattering experimental setups as observed for the cement paste. In this context, we demonstrate that the structure of flocculated clay suspension exhibit two well-distinct regimes of aggregation, a dense mass fractal aggregation at short distance and a more open structure at large distance, which can be generated by a 3D reaction limited cluster-cluster aggregation process. For the first time, a high-resolution 3D image of fibrillar cement paste cluster was obtained from limited angle nanotomography.},

	abstract = {In systems possessing spatial or dynamical symmetry breaking, Brownian motion combined with unbiased external input signals, deterministic and random alike, can assist directed motion of particles at submicron scales. In such cases, one speaks of “Brownian motors.” In this review the constructive role of Brownian motion is exemplified for various physical and technological setups, which are inspired by the cellular molecular machinery: the working principles and characteristics of stylized devices are discussed to show how fluctuations, either thermal or extrinsic, can be used to control diffusive particle transport. Recent experimental demonstrations of this concept are surveyed with particular attention to transport in artificial, i.e., nonbiological, nanopores, lithographic tracks, and optical traps, where single-particle currents were first measured. Much emphasis is given to two- and three-dimensional devices containing many interacting particles of one or more species; for this class of artificial motors, noise rectification results also from the interplay of particle Brownian motion and geometric constraints. Recently, selective control and optimization of the transport of interacting colloidal particles and magnetic vortices have been successfully achieved, thus leading to the new generation of microfluidic and superconducting devices presented here. The field has recently been enriched with impressive experimental achievements in building artificial Brownian motor devices that even operate within the quantum domain by harvesting quantum Brownian motion. Sundry akin topics include activities aimed at noise-assisted shuttling other degrees of freedom such as charge, spin, or even heat and the assembly of chemical synthetic molecular motors. This review ends with a perspective for future pathways and potential new applications.},

	abstract = {An approach is developed to obtain statistical properties similar to those of an infinite bulk system from computer simulations of a finite cluster. A rigorous theoretical formulation is given for the solvent boundary potential which takes the influence of the surrounding bulk into account. The solvent boundary potential is the configuration‐dependent solvation free energy of an effective cluster composed of an arbitrary solute and a finite number of explicit solvent molecules embedded inside a hard sphere of variable radius; the hard sphere does not act directly on the solute or the explicit solvent molecules, and its radius varies according to the instantaneous configurations. The formulation follows from an exact separation of the multidimensional configurational Boltzmann integral in terms of the solvent molecules nearest to the solute and the remaining bulk solvent molecules. An approximation to the solvent boundary potential is constructed for simulations of bulk water at constant pressure, including the influence of van der Waals and electrostaticinteractions. The approximation is illustrated with calculations of the solvation free energy of a water molecule and of sodium and potassiumions. The influence of bulk solvent on the conformational equilibrium of molecular solutes is illustrated by performing umbrella sampling calculations of n‐butane and alanine dipeptide in water. The boundary potential is tested to examine the dependence of the results on the number of water molecules included explicitly in the simulations. It is observed that bulk‐like results are obtained, even when only the waters in the first hydration shell are included explicitly.},

The quadrupole moment induced by the nuclear quadrupole moment Q is 46.5Q, 8.7Q, 50.2Q, and 86.8Q for the Cl-, Cu+, Rb+, and Cs+ ions, respectively. When an external charge interacts with the ion as in a polar molecule, the induced moment is added to Q, so that the quadrupole coupling is multiplied by a factor of order 10-100. This model of a polar molecule disregards the exchange repulsion between the ions. Evidence is presented from several molecules which seems to confirm the existence of the induced quadrupole moment, although there is only partial agreement with the experimental values. It is shown that the contribution to the quadrupole coupling due to the induced dipole moment in second order is small compared to the induced quadrupole effect.},

Both developed and transient concentrations are considered in the analysis; the former is governed by the Taylor dispersion model, while the latter is required in order to formulate proper initial data for the developed mean concentration. The various components of the effective dispersion coefficient, valid when the developed state is attained, are derived as functions of the Schmidt number, flow oscillation frequency, phase partitioning and kinetics of the two reactions. Being more general than those available in the literature, this effective dispersion coefficient incorporates the combined effects of wall retention and absorption on the otherwise classical Taylor dispersion mechanism. It is found that if the phase exchange reaction kinetics is strong enough, the dispersion coefficient is probably to be increased by orders of magnitude by changing the tube wall from being non-retentive to being just weakly retentive.},

Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 \% is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

	abstract = {Iron–sulfur clusters are ubiquitous electron transfer cofactors in hydrogenases. Their types and redox properties are important for H2 catalysis, but, recently, their role in a protection mechanism against oxidative inactivation has also been recognized for a [4Fe-3S] cluster in O2-tolerant group 1 [NiFe] hydrogenases. This cluster, which is uniquely coordinated by six cysteines, is situated in the proximity of the catalytic [NiFe] site and exhibits unusual redox versatility. The [4Fe-3S] cluster in hydrogenase (Hase) I from Aquifex aeolicus performs two redox transitions within a very small potential range, forming a superoxidized state above +200 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Crystallographic data has revealed that this state is stabilized by the coordination of one of the iron atoms to a backbone nitrogen. Thus, the proximal [4Fe-3S] cluster undergoes redox-dependent changes to serve multiple purposes beyond classical electron transfer. In this paper, we present field-dependent 57Fe-Mössbauer and EPR data for Hase I, which, in conjunction with spectroscopically calibrated density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal the distribution of Fe valences and spin-coupling schemes for the iron–sulfur clusters. The data demonstrate that the electronic structure of the [4Fe-3S] core in its three oxidation states closely resembles that of corresponding conventional [4Fe-4S] cubanes, albeit with distinct differences for some individual iron sites. The medial and distal iron–sulfur clusters have similar electronic properties as the corresponding cofactors in standard hydrogenases, although their redox potentials are higher.},

We then succeed in giving simple analytical expressions for the thermodynamic functions of the Lennard-Jones fluid shown to be quite good at high density. We show that the remainder of the perturbation series, which converges slowly at lower density, can be evaluated with the help of the Percus-Yevick equation. We therefore possess a unified theory of liquids which is especially simple at high density. Finally we reexpress the original WCA theory in an analytical form.},

The effects of these impurities on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of chromium are discussed with special emphasis on the hyperfine interaction. It is shown that the filled d shell 4d atoms are nonmagnetic with weak bonding while other impurities have considerable magnetic moments and stronger coupling with the nearest neighbors. Two different magnetic states are identified for Fe impurity in the Cr host, one with high and the other with low magnetic moments, the latter being theoretically more stable, in agreement with experimental observations. Our calculated hyperfine fields on the impurities are highly overestimated, compared with the experimental results. Such overestimation can be improved by implementing a simple model based on the scaling behavior of magnetic properties in chromium. The overestimation factor obtained by this model can be used for predicting hyperfine field values on 4d impurities in a Cr host.},

LEED intensity analyses show that the multilayer relaxation of both clean Fe\{001\} and 3-layer thick Ni films involves 5\% contraction of the first and 5\% expansion of the second interlayer spacing. These new values of the multilayer relaxation of clean Fe\{001\} represent an improvement over previous determinations.

	abstract = {The longitudinal frequency and wave-vector dependent complex dielectric response function χ(k,ω)=1−1/ϵ(k,ω) is calculated in a broad range of k values by means of molecular dynamics computer simulation for a central force model of water. Its imaginary part, i.e.,  Im\{ϵ(k,ω)\}/∣ϵ(k,ω)∣2, shows two main contributions in the region of small k values: Debye-like orientational relaxation in the lower frequency part of the spectrum and a damped librational resonance at the high frequency wing. The Debye relaxation time does not follow a de Gennes-like pattern: τ(k) goes through a maximum at k≈k∗≈1.7 Å−1, while the static polar structure factor S(k) peaks at k≈3 Å−1. The resonance frequency ω(k) and the decay decrement γ(k) show a dispersion law, indicative of a decaying optical-like mode, the libron. With an approximate normal mode approach, we analyze the origin of this mode on a molecular level which shows that it is due to a damped propagation of molecular orientational vibrations through the network of hydrogen bonds. At high k the decay, due to dissipation of collective into single particle motions, dominates. The static dielectric function is calculated on the basis of the response function spectra via the Kramers–Kronig relation. In the small k region ϵ(k) decreases from the macroscopic value ϵ≈80 to a value ≈15, i.e. it exhibits a Lorentzian-type behavior. This behavior is shown to be determined by higher order multipole correlation functions. In the intermediate and high k range, our results on ϵ(k) and χ(k) are in excellent agreement with data extracted from experimental partial pair correlation functions: ϵ(k) exhibits two divergence points on the k axis with a range of negative values in between where a maximum in χ(k) is found with χmax(k)≫1, indicative of overscreening. Consequences of quantum corrections to χ(k) with respect to a purely classical calculation are discussed and consequences are shown for the interaction energy between hydrated ions. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

From first-principles calculations and the experimental critical temperature we build a new energetic rigid lattice model based on pair interactions with concentration and temperature dependence. Density functional theory calculations in both norm-conserving and projector augmented-wave approaches have been performed. A thorough comparison of these two different ab initio techniques leads to a robust parametrization of the Fe-Cr Hamiltonian. Mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo calculations are then used to account for temperature effects. The predictions of the model are in agreement with the most recent phase diagram at all temperatures and compositions. The solubility of Cr in Fe below 700 K remains in the range of about 6 to 12\%. It reproduces the transition between the ordering and demixing tendency and the spinodal decomposition limits are also in agreement with the values given in the literature.},

Depending on the experimental deposition conditions, the analysis of the deposits by SEM/EDX has revealed the presence of a Zr metal thin film with various porosities and compositions.

We employ a thermodynamic route proposed by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys.123, 134703 (2005)] to determine the surface tension that involves the estimate of the change in free energy associated with a small change in the interfacial area at constant volume. The values of the surface tension computed from this test-area method are found to be fully consistent with those obtained from the standard mechanical route, which is based on the evaluation of the components of the pressuretensor. We find that most models do not reproduce quantitatively the experimental values of the surface tension of water. The best description of the surface tension is given by those models that provide a better description of the vapor-liquid coexistence curve. The values of the surface tension for the SPC/E and TIP4P/Ew models are found to be in reasonably good agreement with the experimental values. From the present investigation, we conclude that the TIP4P/2005 model is able to accurately describe the surface tension of water over the whole range of temperatures from the triple point to the critical temperature. We also conclude that the test area is an appropriate methodological choice for the calculation of the surface tension not only for simple fluids, but also for complex molecular polar fluids, as is the case of water.},

	abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic–isobaric, canonical, and isothermal–isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be useful are discussed.},

The TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P-i models produced better values for the surface tension than the other water models. We also examined the correlation of the data to scaling temperatures based on the critical and melting temperatures. The reduced temperature (T/T c) gives consistent equilibrium densities and pressure, and the shifted temperature T + (T c, exp − T c, sim) gives consistent surface tension among all models considered in this study. The modified fixed charge model which has the same Lennard-Jones parameters as the TIP4P-FQ model but uses an adjustable molecular dipole moment is also simulated to find the differences in the vapor–liquid coexistence properties between fixed and fluctuating charge models. The TIP4P-FQ model (2.72 Debye) gives the best estimate of the experimental surface tension. The equilibrium vapor density and pressure are unaffected by changes in the dipole moment as well as the surface tension and liquid density.},

This article relates the Si(IV) reaction study to define a relative fluoroacidity scale by studying the silicon ions stability in different melts. Electrochemical techniques allow the measurement of SiF4 + xx− concentration evolution and thus the reaction rate constant to be calculated at different temperatures and for several fluoride media. The article shows that the free F− content depends on the fluoride mixture and that the rate values are correlated with the fluoroacidity allowing a qualitative estimation. Then a fluoride solvents fluoroacidity scale was proposed, scaling the different eutectic melts from basic melt to acidic one: NaF–KF \&lt; LiF–KF \&lt; NaF–MgF2 \&lt; NaF–CaF2 \&lt; LiF–NaF \&lt; LiF \&lt; LiF–CaF2.},

The magnetic diffuse scattering gives a direct measure of the spatial magnetic moment distribution at and around impurity sites in a magnetic host. It has been found that the Fe possesses an ordered antiferromagnetic moment which is coupled into the SDW in both alloys. For the 2.8\% Fe sample, the iron moment is (2.13+or-0.05) mu B , and the chromium moment is (0.72+or-0.02) mu B . For the 4\% Fe sample, the moments are (1.8+or-0.1) mu B and (0.72+or-0.02) mu B for iron and chromium respectively. No significant disturbances on the Cr neighbours of Fe atoms have been found.},

Here, using molecular dynamics simulation, we provide an explanation of recent x-ray and neutron solution scattering data that indicate that the density of water on the surface of lysozyme is significantly higher than that of bulk water. The simulation-derived scattering profiles are in excellent agreement with the experiment. In the simulation, the 3-Å-thick first hydration layer is 15\% denser than bulk water. About two-thirds of this increase is the result of a geometric contribution that would also be present if the water was unperturbed from the bulk. The remaining third arises from modification of the water structure and dynamics, involving approximately equal contributions from shortening of the average water–water O–O distance and an increase in the coordination number. Variation in the first hydration shell density is shown to be determined by topographical and electrostatic properties of the protein surface. On average, denser water is found in depressions on the surface in which the water dipoles tend to be aligned parallel to each other by the electrostatic field generated by the protein atoms.},

In this letter we propose an alternative formulation of the reciprocal space terms generalized to higher multipoles, providing, at the same time, a few important corrections for previously published derivations. The present expressions, more compact than the ones proposed in the original work, provide a straightforward approach to implement an Ewald summation scheme for multipole interactions in codes where a standard Ewald summation is already available. A major result of the present derivation is an increase in the computational efficiency compared to the previous implementation of the several different electrostatic terms.},

Conventional ion solvation properties, based on the standard heat of formation of H+(aq) set to zero, have been devised that may be confusing to the uninitiated but are useful in thermochemical evaluations because they avoid the unnecessary introduction of the larger uncertainties in our knowledge of absolute values. In a similar strategy, we have motivated the need for a reassessment of ?Haq°[H+] by the trends with increased clustering in conventional cluster-ion solvation enthalpy differences for pairs of oppositely charged cluster ions. The consequences of particular preferred values for ?Haq°[H+] may be evaluated with regard to cluster-ion properties and how they connect to the bulk.

This approach, called the cluster-pair-based approximation for ?Haq°[H+], becomes exact for the idealized pair of ions that have obtained the same fraction of their bulk values at the same cluster size. The true value of ?Haq°[H+] is revealed by the linear deviations of real pairs of ions from this idealized behavior.

	abstract = {High throughput (combinatorial) materials science methodology is a relatively new research paradigm that offers the promise of rapid and efficient materials screening, optimization, and discovery. The paradigm started in the pharmaceutical industry but was rapidly adopted to accelerate materials research in a wide variety of areas. High throughput experiments are characterized by synthesis of a “library” sample that contains the materials variation of interest (typically composition), and rapid and localized measurement schemes that result in massive data sets. Because the data are collected at the same time on the same “library” sample, they can be highly uniform with respect to fixed processing parameters. This article critically reviews the literature pertaining to applications of combinatorial materials science for electronic, magnetic, optical, and energy-related materials. It is expected that high throughput methodologies will facilitate commercialization of novel materials for these critically important applications. Despite the overwhelming evidence presented in this paper that high throughput studies can effectively inform commercial practice, in our perception, it remains an underutilized research and development tool. Part of this perception may be due to the inaccessibility of proprietary industrial research and development practices, but clearly the initial cost and availability of high throughput laboratory equipment plays a role. Combinatorial materials science has traditionally been focused on materials discovery, screening, and optimization to combat the extremely high cost and long development times for new materials and their introduction into commerce. Going forward, combinatorial materials science will also be driven by other needs such as materials substitution and experimental verification of materials properties predicted by modeling and simulation, which have recently received much attention with the advent of the Materials Genome Initiative. Thus, the challenge for combinatorial methodology will be the effective coupling of synthesis, characterization and theory, and the ability to rapidly manage large amounts of data in a variety of formats.},

	abstract = {The response of water to a change of charge of a solvated ion is, to a good approximation, linear for the type of iron-like ions frequently used as a model system in classical force field studies of electron transfer. Free energies for such systems can be directly calculated from average vertical energy gaps. Exploiting this feature, we have computed the free energy and the reorganization energy of the M2+/M3+ and M1+/M2+ oxidations in a series of model systems all containing a single Mn+ ion and an increasing number of simple point charge water molecules. Long-range interactions are taken into account by Ewald summation methods. Our calculations confirm the observation made by Hummer, Pratt, and Garcia (J. Phys. Chem. 1996, 100, 1206) that the finite size correction to the estimate of solvation energy (and hence oxidation free energy) in such a setup is effectively proportional to the inverse third power (1/L3) of the length L of the periodic cell. The finite size correction to the reorganization energy is found to scale with 1/L. These simulation results are analyzed using a periodic generalization of the Born cavity model for solvation, yielding three different estimates of the cavity radius, namely, from the infinite system size extrapolation of oxidation free energy and reorganization energy, and from the slope of the linear dependence of oxidation free energy on 1/L3. The cavity radius for the reorganization energy is found to be significantly larger compared to the radius for the oxidation (solvation) free energy. The radius controlling the 1/L3 dependence of oxidation free energy is found to be comparable to the radius for reorganization. The implication of these results for density functional theory-based ab initio molecular dynamics calculation of redox potentials is discussed.},

	abstract = {Spin dynamics (SD) methods have been developed to compute NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (NMR-PRE) produced by solutes with electron spin S ≥ 1 in solution. The spin dynamics algorithms, which are implemented as the computer program SpinDyn.f, are similar in spirit to molecular dynamics calculations in statistical mechanics, except that the spin motion is propagated numerically in time using quantum mechanical equations of motion of the spin operators, rather than Newtonian equations of motion of the molecular degrees of freedom as in MD simulations. SD simulations as implemented in SpinDyn.f provide accurate, flexible, and rapid calculations of NMR-PRE phenomena with few of the assumptions or limitations of previous analytical theories. The program calculates inter- and intramolecular NMR-PRE phenomena for both integer and half-integer spin systems processing under arbitrary Zeeman and zfs Hamiltonians in the presence of Brownian reorientation. Isotropic Brownian reorientation is simulated by means of a finite-step algorithm with adjustable step size. Simulations computed by SpinDyn.f have been used in a systematic study aimed at better understanding the influence of Brownian reorientation on the NMR-PRE of an S = 1 ion in a non-Zeeman-limit physical situation. Conditions required for the validity of zfs-limit analytical theory are given. SpinDyn.f has also been used to assess quantitatively the effects of molecular reorientation on a prior analysis of NMR-PRE data for the model S = 2 complex ion [tris-(acetylacetonato)manganese(III)] in acetone solution; this system was found to be well described by zfs-limit analytical theory. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Graphene-based materials can have well-defined nanometer pores and can exhibit low frictional water flow inside them, making their properties of interest for filtration and separation. We investigate permeation through micrometer-thick laminates prepared by means of vacuum filtration of graphene oxide suspensions. The laminates are vacuum-tight in the dry state but, if immersed in water, act as molecular sieves, blocking all solutes with hydrated radii larger than 4.5 angstroms. Smaller ions permeate through the membranes at rates thousands of times faster than what is expected for simple diffusion. We believe that this behavior is caused by a network of nanocapillaries that open up in the hydrated state and accept only species that fit in. The anomalously fast permeation is attributed to a capillary-like high pressure acting on ions inside graphene capillaries.
On the Fast Track
Membranes based on graphene can simultaneously block the passage of very small molecules while allowing the rapid permeation of water. Joshi et al. (p. 752; see the Perspective by Mi) investigated the permeation of ions and neutral molecules through a graphene oxide (GO) membrane in an aqueous solution. Small ions, with hydrated radii smaller than 0.45 nanometers, permeated through the GO membrane several orders of magnitude faster than predicted, based on diffusion theory. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the GO membrane can attract a high concentration of small ions into the membrane, which may explain the fast ion transport.},

	abstract = {The hydration structures of the hydrophobic solutes benzene and cyclohexane were investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a single solute in water. Detailed, spatially resolved, three-dimensional maps of the density of the water O and H atoms surrounding either benzene or cyclohexane were generated from the simulation data. MD simulations were computed for each solute using either the ENCAD or GROMACS program package and one of five distinct water models:? F3C, TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC, or SPC/E. For each solute, five 100 ns data sets, each representing a unique simulation condition, were analyzed. The water structure maps generated from the five data sets for each solute are remarkably similar. Our results show that water molecules in the first hydration shell around cyclohexane bind weakly. In contrast, water molecules bind more strongly and in a hydrogen-bonding orientation to the faces of the benzene ring. The high-resolution maps of the water structure surrounding benzene and cyclohexane presented in this paper reveal details of the positional preferences of water not resolved by other methods. They also show that the hydration structure at this level of detail is remarkably insensitive to the potential energy functions and simulation methods used.},

	abstract = {NPT and NVT molecular dynamics simulation results are reported for the fluid methane-ethane mixture. Methane is modelled as Lennard-Jones fluid and ethane as a two-centre Lennard-Jones fluid with parameters obtained some time ago by fitting WCA-type perturbation theory results to two experimental vapour pressures and one bubble density for each substance. It has also already been shown that these effective pair potentials yield good predictions of the pressures and internal energies of the pure substances in the whole fluid region. In order to obtain an effective potential between the unlike molecules, previously derived fluctuation formulas for the dependence of the mixture excess properties on the unlike molecule interaction parameters are used. A test of these fluctuation formulas shows their statistical uncertainties to be small. Hence, the unlike interaction parameters can be determined from one mixture simulation and a fit to one experimental excess volume and one excess enthalpy. Then second virial coefficients, liquid excess properties, P, V, T data and enthalpy differences are calculated in the temperature range 100–400 K and pressures up to 30 MPa. Comparison is made directly with experimental data and partly also with the DDMIX equation of state showing mostly good to excellent agreement except in the critical region; for some state points in the gas the pressures are slightly too low. Technically, runs for several gas state points are NVT simulations whereas the other runs are NPT simulations part of which were checked again by NVT-simulations. The paper also compares pressures obtained by the Haar-Shenker-Kohler equation for the gas phase with NVT simulation results. All simulations were performed on a CYBER 205.},

The N-heterocyclic carbene 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene (Pri2NHCMe2) has been found to stabilize the fully reduced clusters [Fe8S8(Pri2NHCMe2)6] (4) and [Fe4S4(Pri2NHCMe2)4] (5), which are prepared by cluster assembly or phosphine substitution of FenSn (n = 8, 16) clusters. Cluster 4 is also obtained by reaction of the carbene with all-ferrous [Fe7S6(PEt3)5Cl2] (3) and cluster 5 by carbene cleavage of 4. Detailed structures of 3 (monocapped prismatic), 4, and 5 are described; the latter two are the first iron?sulfur clusters with Fe?C σ bonds. Cluster 4 possesses the [Fe8(?3-S)6(?4-S)2] edge-bridged double cubane structure and 5 the cubane-type [Fe4(?3-S)4] stereochemistry. The all-ferrous formulations of the clusters are confirmed by X-ray structure parameters and 57Fe isomer shifts. Both clusters are stable under conventional aprotic anaerobic conditions, enabling further study of reactivity. The collective properties of 5 indicate that it is a meaningful synthetic analogue of the core of the fully reduced protein-bound cluster.},

In the case of a 5 mol l -1 electrolyte, the results for pair correlations obtained by the two methods are in excellent agreement. However, the charged-clouds technique is much faster than Ewald summation and makes simulations at lower salt concentrations feasible. It is found that both ion-water and ion-ion correlation functions depend only weakly on the ionic concentration. Sodium and chloride ions exhibit only a negligible tendency to form contact pairs. In particular, no chloride ion pairs in contact are observed.},

We review data previously published and present new results which show that cesium sorption on potassium- and calcium-saturated illite is kinetically controlled. Two kinetic models incorporating Freundlich isotherms and an irreversible process are used to describe sorption data spanning a range of cesium concentrations. Although empirical in nature and origin, the models are consistent with mechanistic hypotheses proposed by earlier workers. The models predict that effectively instantaneous and reversible kinetic processes control cesium sorption over time scales of a few days and less. Irreversible or apparently irreversible sorption is more significant over longer times. The implications of our findings for radiocesium remobilization in anoxic sediments and transport in the water column are discussed.},

primarly focuses on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and its usage in computing the integral of a three-
dimensional spherical function. This particular example is chosen due to the natural transition to
angular quadrature and extension to the integration of arbitrary three-dimensional functions; how-
ever, the concepts discussed with the Gauss-Laguerre example are easily applied to Gauss-Hermite
quadrature, for example, and its application to anharmonic oscillator problems. Multicenter molecular
quadrature is discussed with emphasis on understanding the conceptual problem of double counting
integrands and the associated requirement of spatial partition functions.},

The accuracy of the DMRG-CASSCF and DMRG-CASPT2 calculations, with respect to the number of renormalized states, the number of roots in state-averaged wave functions, and the number basis functions, was examined. For the current system, chemically accurate results can be obtained with a relatively small number of renormalized states. The nature and vertical excitation energies of the excited (S1 and S2) states are consistent with conventional CAS(or RAS)PT2 with medium active spaces. The capability of the DMRG-CASSCF method in the optimization of molecular geometry is demonstrated for the first time. The computation costs (several hours per optimization cycle) are comparable with that of the conventional CASSCF geometry optimization with small active space. Finally, the DMRG-PT2 computed S1-MEP for the C–O and C–N bond-cleavage processes show good agreement with our previous calculations with a CAS(12e,10o) active space [Liu, F.; Morokuma, K. J. Am.

In this study we systematically tested the ability of the NP theory to accurately predict channel currents by combining and comparing the results with those of Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. To thoroughly test the theory in a range of situations, calculations were made in a series of simplified cylindrical channels with radii ranging from 3 to 15 Å, in a more complex ‘catenary’ channel, and in a realistic model of the mechanosensitive channel MscS. The extensive tests indicate that the NP equation is applicable in narrow ion channels provided that accurate concentrations and potentials can be input as the currents obtained from the combination of BD and NP match well with those obtained directly from BD simulations, although some discrepancies are seen when the ion concentrations are not radially uniform. This finding opens a door to utilising the results of microscopic simulations in continuum theory, something that is likely to be useful in the investigation of a range of biophysical and nano-scale applications and should stimulate further studies in this direction.},

This missing quantity is included in the present paper. Using a precise hydrodynamic force multipole simulation method, the rotational self-diffusion coefficient is evaluated for concentrated suspensions of permeable particles. Results are presented for particle volume fractions up to 45\% and for a wide range of permeability values. From the simulation results and earlier results for the first-order virial coefficient, we find that the rotational self-diffusion coefficient of permeable spheres can be scaled to the corresponding coefficient of impermeable particles of the same size. We also show that a similar scaling applies to the translational self-diffusion coefficient considered earlier. From the scaling relations, accurate analytic approximations for the rotational and translational self-diffusion coefficients in concentrated systems are obtained, useful to the experimental analysis of permeable-particle diffusion. The simulation results for rotational diffusion of permeable particles are used to show that a generalized Stokes-Einstein-Debye relation between rotational self-diffusion coefficient and high-frequency viscosity is not satisfied.},

In ionic systems, it is possible to introduce physically motivated model potentials for the interactions, in which additional degrees of freedom provide a ‘cartoon’ of the response of the electronic structure of the ions to their changing coordination environments and allow the compact representation of many-body contributions to the interaction energy. These potentials may then be parameterized by fitting the predicted forces and multipoles to a large body of information generated from ab initio calculations. The resulting potentials are predictive, of ab initio accuracy and have a high degree of transferability between different systems.},

Their migration mechanism is similar to that for SIAs, with an activation energy of 0.42 eV.

This is consistent with ab initio calculation, but no simpler physically intuitive picture has been presented. Here it is shown that the Ising model, based on the bcc lattice with antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic species, has the potential to exhibit similar behavior, with a skew miscibility gap arising from the solubility of antiferromagnetic species on nonadjacent sites. Essential characteristics of stainless steel (high Cr solubility and surface segregation) are correctly reproduced. Under some conditions, magnetization increases with temperature. The equilibrium miscibility gap due to mixed magnetism and segregation-driven positive dM/dT are fundamental features of the bcc Ising model itself, not just FeCr.},

This led to a whole series of new water models with additional van der Waals interaction sites at the hydrogen atoms, modified partial charges and modified geometries. The properties of these models are analyzed and discussed. Particular emphasis has been put on the study of the dependence and sensitivity of water properties on the model parameters. We found that a simultaneous improvement of the dielectricpermittivity and the diffusion coefficient is difficult to attain for a rigid, nonpolarizable three interaction site model. Nevertheless, two of the models presented here, SPC/A and SPC/L, show good agreement with experimental data on water and have been characterized in more detail. We conclude that SPC/L represents the overall properties of water better than SPC. Especially, it shows excellent dielectric properties, an improved shear viscosity and a slightly lower diffusion coefficient.},

We argue that the derivative -( partial differential ln delta/ partial differentialT)(P) should behave roughly as the constant pressure specific heat C(P)(T), and we confirm this argument by detailed comparisons with literature values of C(P)(T) in the range 290-370 K. We find that -( partial differential ln delta/ partial differentialT)(P) displays a pronounced maximum upon crossing the locus of maximum correlation length at approximately 240 K, consistent with the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis for water, which predicts that C(P)(T) displays a maximum on crossing the Widom line.},

However, many problems still need to be solved before this method can be applied routinely. At the start of such a calculation, the orbitals originating from a preceding quantum chemical calculation must be placed in a specific order on a one-dimensional lattice. This ordering affects the convergence of the density-matrix renormalization group iterations significantly. In this paper, we present two approaches to obtain optimized orderings of the orbitals. First, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the ordering with respect to a low total electronic energy obtained at a predefined stage of the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm with a given number of total states kept. In addition to that, we derive orderings from the one- and two-electron integrals of our test system. This test molecule is the chromium dimer, which is known to possess a complicated electronic structure. For this molecule, we have carried out calculations for the various orbital orderings obtained. The convergence behavior of the density-matrix renormalization group iterations is discussed in detail.},

The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

Here, we present a unified mean-field theory for capacitive charging and desalination by ideally polarizable porous electrodes (without Faradaic reactions or specific adsorption of ions) valid in the limit of thin double layers (compared to typical pore dimensions). We illustrate the theory for the case of a dilute, symmetric, binary electrolyte using the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model of the double layer, for which simple formulae are available for salt adsorption and capacitive charging of the diffuse part of the double layer. We solve the full GCS mean-field theory numerically for realistic parameters in capacitive deionization, and we derive reduced models for two limiting regimes with different time scales: (i) in the “supercapacitor regime” of small voltages and/or early times, the porous electrode acts like a transmission line, governed by a linear diffusion equation for the electrostatic potential, scaled to the RC time of a single pore, and (ii) in the “desalination regime” of large voltages and long times, the porous electrode slowly absorbs counterions, governed by coupled, nonlinear diffusion equations for the pore-averaged potential and salt concentration.},

Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

	abstract = {The canonical partition function for classical many-body systems is transformed so that the temperature-independent packing statistics and the thermal excitations are uniquely separated. This requires classification of particle configurations according to multidimensional potential-energy minima that can be reached by steepest-descent paths ("quenches"). Such classifications have been constructed for several starting configurations in the solid, fluid, and coexistence phases of the two-dimensional Gaussian core model. These quenches reveal a remarkable degree of polycrystalline order hidden within the fluid phase by "vibrational" distortion, and that order appears to have a large correlation length. The results suggest that melting hinges upon defect softening in the quenched packings, and a crude "theory" of melting for the Gaussian core model is developed in the Appendix.},

Using singlet states between inequivalent spin pairs has been shown to extend the signal lifetime by more than an order of magnitude compared to the spin lattice relaxation time (T1), but they have to be prevented from evolving into other states. In the most interesting case the singlet is between chemically equivalent spins, as it can then be inherently an eigenstate. However this presents major challenges in the conversion from bulk magnetization to singlet. In the only case demonstrated so far, a reversible chemical reaction to break symmetry was required. Here we present a pulse sequence technique that interconverts between singlet spin order and bulk magnetization without breaking the symmetry of the spin system. This technique is independent of field strength and is applicable to a broad range of molecules.},

Is the action of cations and anions on water cooperative or not? Here, we investigate how the reorientation and hydrogen-bond dynamics of water are affected by ions in dilute and concentrated aqueous salt solutions. By combining simulations and analytic modeling, we first show that ions have a short-ranged influence on the reorientation of individual water molecules and that depending on their interaction strength with water, they may accelerate or slow down water dynamics. A simple additive picture combining the effects of the cations and anions is found to provide a good description in dilute solutions. In concentrated solutions, we show that the average water reorientation time ceases to scale linearly with salt concentration due to overlapping hydration shells and structural rearrangements which reduce the translational displacements induced by hydrogen-bond switches and increase the solution viscosity. This effect is not ion-specific and explains why all concentrated salt solutions slow down water dynamics. Our picture, which is demonstrated to be robust vis-a-vis a change in the force-field, reconciles the seemingly contradictory experimental results obtained by ultrafast infrared and NMR spectroscopies, and suggests that there are no long-ranged cooperative ion effects on the dynamics of individual water molecules in dilute solutions.},

Diffusion in different media and through lipid bilayers is in many cases the rate-determining step for the distribution in the body. In the present review an attempt is made to demonstrate the importance of solvation of drug molecules for the diffusion and partition/distribution in phases of different lipophilicity. Different approaches known in the literature to describe solvation of compounds with flexible conformation are discussed as well as the experimental methods to directly measure the energy of solvation. NSAIDs are chosen as an example of a class of drugs of different molecular structures that have already been studied thoroughly in many aspects, and a set of aliphatic alcohols can be used as a model for compartments of different lipophilic/hydrophilic properties. Thermodynamic characteristics of solvation of the drug molecules yielded by independent classical experimental methods (Gibbs energy, enthalpic and entropic terms of Gibbs energy) are studied in order to better understand diffusion and distribution properties. Correlations between in-vitro-data (partition coefficient, enthalpy of solvation) with biopharmaceutically relevant characteristics (plasma half-life) are also discussed.},

(2007) A computer simulation study of natural silicate melts. Part I: low pressure properties. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 71, 1249–1265]. It is shown that the simulation reproduces accurately the bulk moduli of a large variety of silicate liquids as evaluated from ultrasonic studies. The equations of state (EOS) of the simulated melts are in good agreement with the density data on mid-ocean ridge basalt, komatiite, peridotite and fayalite as obtained either by sink/float experiments or by shock-wave compression. From the structural point of view it is shown that the population of [5]Al and [6]Al species increases rapidly upon initial compression (0–50 kbar) whereas for Si these highly coordinated species are found in a significant abundance (\&gt;5\%) only above ∼50 kbar for [5]Si and ∼100–150 kbar for [6]Si. This increase of the coordination of network formers is not the only response of the melt structure to the densification: there is also a large redistribution of the T–O–T (T = Si, Al) bond angles with the pressure and noticeably upon initial compression in rhyolitic and basaltic liquids. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the population of bridging oxygens (BO) and nonbridging oxygens (NBO) points out that the polymerization of the melt generally increases when the pressure increases, the magnitude of this polymerization enhancement being all the more important that the melt is depolymerized at low pressure. The role of triclusters (threefold coordinated oxygens to network former cations) is particularly emphasized in acidic and basaltic liquids. The pressure-induced redistribution of the oxygen atoms through the melt structure is also stressed. Finally, the simulation predicts a nonmonotonic behavior of the diffusivity of network former ions when the pressure increases, a feature with depends on the melt composition. This could have a counterpart in the electrical conductivity at sufficiently high temperature when the viscosity of the liquid is low.},

Here, we present our results for the local magnetic properties of 3d (Sc–Ni) and 4d (Y–Pd) impurities in Cr, as well as changes in macroscopic properties such as total magnetization and specific heat of Cr alloys, arising from impurity-induced host perturbations. Results obtained for nonmagnetic local density of states is analyzed within Stoner model, and the condition for local moment formation is found to be satisfied only for Fe, Co, and Ni. For all other cases including Mn, the impurity moments are predicted to be induced by Cr host. Systematic trends for the impurity local moments and hyperfine fields in antiferromagnetic Cr host have been established. The trends show remarkable similarity with those observed in ferromagnetic Fe, Co, and Ni hosts. While the impurity moments for Sc, Ti, V, and Mn are found to be antiparallel with respect to the near neighbor Cr moment, self-consistent solutions for Fe, Co, and Ni show ferromagnetic coupling. For 4d impurities, except for Rh and Pd, the exchange interaction remain antiferromagnetic. The calculated changes of the total moment due to host perturbations show qualitative agreements with data from magnetization measurements. A detailed comparison is made for the impurity-induced changes in the total density of states at Fermi energy EF and experimentally measured electronic specific heat of Cr alloys. The results presented in this work provide comprehensive and improved understanding of electronic and magnetic properties of dilute Cr alloys. They are also useful for a common understanding of local magnetic properties of transition metal impurities in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic hosts.},

The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c * 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m c of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m c c * 2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

Each elementary step in the methanol decomposition reaction on clean Ir(111) via O?H, C?H, and C?O bond scissions was considered. The formation mechanisms of CO, CO2, H2O, and CHx(x = 1?3) were elucidated. The results show that the desorption and decomposition of methanol are competitive on a clean surface, and the presence of O or OH has a larger effect on some specific reaction steps. The surface-assisted decomposition of methanol mainly follows two competitive dehydrogenation pathways initialed with O?H and C?H bond scissions, respectively, i.e., CH3OH ? CH3O ? HCHO ? CHO ? CO and CH3OH ? CH2OH ? CHOH ? CHO ? CO. The predosed O enhances the dehydrogenation of CH3OH into CH3O, while the surface is slightly more active toward the C?H bond breaking of CH3O than O and OH. HCHO would like to dehydrogenate into CHO assisted by the surface or OH, followed by OH-assisted dehydrogenation into CO. CO combines with O to yield CO2. However, if the surface O coverage is higher, CO2 could be formed via the oxidation pathway of HCHO, i.e., HCHO H2CO2 HCO2 ? CO2.

	abstract = {A multireference second-order perturbation theory approach based on the generalized active space self-consistent-field (GASSCF) wave function is presented. Compared with the complete active space (CAS) and restricted active space (RAS) wave functions, GAS wave functions are more flexible and can employ larger active spaces and/or different truncations of the configuration interaction expansion. With GASSCF, one can explore chemical systems that are not affordable with either CASSCF or RASSCF. Perturbation theory to second order on top of GAS wave functions (GASPT2) has been implemented to recover the remaining electron correlation. The method has been benchmarked by computing the chromium dimer ground-state potential energy curve. These calculations show that GASPT2 gives results similar to CASPT2 even with a configuration interaction expansion much smaller than the corresponding CAS expansion.},

In contrast to traditional approaches, this algorithm is believed to yield arbitrarily high accuracy in the energy with only polynomial computational effort. We describe in some detail how this is achieved. We begin by introducing the principles of the renormalization procedure, and how one formulates an algorithm for use in quantum chemistry. The renormalization group algorithm is then interpreted in terms of familiar quantum chemical concepts, and its numerical behavior, including its convergence and computational cost, are studied using both model and real systems. The asymptotic convergence of the algorithm is derived. Finally, we examine the performance of the DMRG on widely studied chemical problems, such as the water molecule, the twisting barrier of ethene, and the dissociation of nitrogen. In all cases, the results compare favorably with the best existing quantum chemical methods, and particularly so when the nondynamical correlation is strong. Some perspectives for future development are given.},

At room temperature, four (I, II, I?, and hydrated sodium cations) and five (I, two III?, II, and I?) sodium sites were identified in NaY and NaX, respectively. Cation occupancies for the different sites were also obtained following sorption of HFC-134, again from the MQMAS and fast MAS spectra. For zeolite NaY, the distribution of the extra-framework cations changed significantly, the SI? cations migrating into the SI site and into the supercages (resulting in occupancy of the SIII? sites), presumably to optimize cation?HFC interactions. No significant change in the SI? cation population was detected following sorption of HFC-134 on zeolite NaX. However, two SI sites, due to different local environments for the cations, within the hexagonal prisms, were observed. Variable-temperature 23Na MAS and 2D MQMAS NMR experiments were performed on bare NaY, to probe rearrangement of the sodium cations above room temperature. The SI resonance was observed to decrease in intensity above 150 °C, and a new resonance was seen. A two-dimensional 23Na-exchange NMR experiment, performed at 250 °C, revealed considerable cation mobility involving the supercage cation sites.},

The intrinsic point defect formation energies were found to be larger in model bcc Cr as compared to those in ferromagnetic bcc Fe. The interactions of Cr with point defects (vacancy and self-interstitials) have been characterized. Single Cr atoms interact weakly with vacancies but significantly with self-interstitial atoms (SIA). Mixed interstitials of any interstitial symmetry are bound. Configurations where two Cr atoms are in nearest-neighbor position are generally unfavorable in bcc Fe except when they are a part of a ⟨111⟩ interstitial complex. Mixed ⟨110⟩ interstitials do not have as strong directional stability as pure Fe interstitials have. The effects on the results using the atom description scheme of either the ultrasoft pseudopotential (USPP) or the projector augmented wave (PAW) formalisms are connected to the differences in local magnetic moments that the two methods predict. As expected for the Fe-Cr system, the results obtained using the PAW method are more reliable than the ones obtained with USPP.},

In this explanation, the size at which the maximum occurs is related to the structure of the void space of the water; at the mobility maximum, the diffusant passes smoothly through necks connecting voids, and its potential energy shows minimum fluctuations. Molecular dynamics simulations of charged spheres of varying sizes are used to support this hypothesis. As in the levitation effect, the friction coefficient, the potential energy fluctuations, and the activation energy are found to be minima for particles with maximum self diffusivities similar to the guest diffusion in zeolites. Wavelength-dependent self diffusivities indicate a monotonic and oscillatory dependence, respectively, on wavenumber k for anomalous (AR) and linear regimes (LR). These are associated with single and biexponential decay of the incoherent intermediate scattering function.},

The model accounts simultaneously for (1) asymmetric electrolytes with (2) multiple ion species, (3) finite ion sizes, and (4) Stern and diffuse layers along with Ohmic potential drop in the electrode. It was used to simulate cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for binary asymmetric electrolytes. The results demonstrated that the current density increased significantly with decreasing ion diameter and/or increasing valency {\textbar}zi{\textbar} of either ion species. By contrast, the ion diffusion coefficients affected the CV curves and capacitance only at large scan rates. Dimensional analysis was also performed, and 11 dimensionless numbers were identified to govern the CV measurements of the electric double layer in binary asymmetric electrolytes between two identical planar electrodes of finite thickness. A self-similar behavior was identified for the electric double-layer integral capacitance estimated from CV measurement simulations. Two regimes were identified by comparing the half cycle period τCV and the ?RC time scale? τRC corresponding to the characteristic time of ions? electrodiffusion. For τRC ? τCV, quasi-equilibrium conditions prevailed and the capacitance was diffusion-independent while for τRC ? τCV, the capacitance was diffusion-limited. The effect of the electrode was captured by the dimensionless electrode electrical conductivity representing the ratio of characteristic times associated with charge transport in the electrolyte and that in the electrode. The model developed here will be useful for simulating and designing various practical electrochemical, colloidal, and biological systems for a wide range of applications.},

Transport coefficients were calculated using the standard Kubo formulas. They are compared with the prediction of a simple hard-sphere model. It is shown that, as in the case of the hard-sphere fluid near solidification, the Kubo-correlation function relative to the shear viscosity presents a tail extending at large time. The inclusion of this tail turns out to be essential in explaining the transverse-correlation function and the dynamical-structure factor, which shows, for the lowest wave vectors accessible in this study, a characteristic Brillouin doublet structure. Using the hydrodynamical model of Zwanzig and Bixon, it is shown that the introduction of the long-time tail in the Kubo-correlation function for the viscosity explains the negative plateau of the velocity-autocorrelation function observed near the triple point by Rahman and others.},

Low-temperature reversible free energy surfaces of several different atomistic models are computed: mW water, TIP4P/2005 water, Stillinger-Weber silicon, and ST2 water, the last of these comparing three different treatments of long-ranged forces. In each case, we show that there is one stable or metastable liquid phase, and there is an ice-like crystal phase. The time scales for crystallization in these systems far exceed those of structural relaxation in the supercooled metastable liquid. We show how this wide separation in time scales produces an illusion of a low-temperature liquid-liquid transition. The phenomenon suggesting metastability of two distinct liquid phases is actually coarsening of the ordered ice-like phase, which we elucidate using both analytical theory and computer simulation. For the latter, we describe robust methods for computing reversible free energy surfaces, and we consider effects of electrostatic boundary conditions. We show that sensible alterations of models and boundary conditions produce no qualitative changes in low-temperature phase behaviors of these systems, only marginal changes in equations of state. On the other hand, we show that altering sampling time scales can produce large and qualitative non-equilibrium effects. Recent reports of evidence of a liquid-liquid critical point in computer simulations of supercooled water are considered in this light.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the dynamics of water around a small globular protein. Dipolar second-rank relaxation time and diffusion properties of surface water were computed by extensive molecular dynamics simulations of lysozyme in water which lasted a total of 28 ns. Our results indicate that the rotational relaxation of water in the vicinity of lysozyme is 3-7 times slower than that in the bulk depending on how the hydration shell is defined in the calculation. We have also verified that the dynamics of water translational diffusion in the vicinity of lysozyme have retardations similar to rotational relaxation. This is a common assumption in nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) studies to derive residence times. In contrast to bulk water dynamics, surface water is in a dispersive diffusion regime or subdiffusion. Very good agreement of dipolar second-rank relaxation time with NMRD estimates is obtained by using appropriate dimensions of the hydration shell. Although our computed second-rank dipolar retardations are independent of the water model, SPC/E describes more realistically the time scale of the water dynamics around lysozyme than does TIP3P.},

The interaction potential, which includes dipole polarization effects, was parametrized using first-principles calculations. Our simulations reproduce the most recent experimental structural data very well. The character of the pressure-induced structural transition in the glassy system has been a matter of controversy. We show that our simulations and the experimental data are consistent with a smooth transition from a tetrahedral to an octahedral network with a significant number of pentacoordinated germanium ions appearing over an extended pressure range. Finally, the study of high-pressure, liquid germania confirms that this material presents an anomalous behaviour of the diffusivity as observed in analogous systems such as silica and water. The importance of pentacoordinated germanium ions for such behaviour is stressed.},

	abstract = {Water confined into the interior channels of narrow carbon nanotubes or transmembrane proteins forms collectively oriented molecular wires held together by tight hydrogen bonds. Here, we explore the thermodynamic stability and dipolar orientation of such 1D water chains from nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions. We show that a dipole lattice model accurately recovers key properties of 1D confined water when compared to atomically detailed simulations. In a major reduction in computational complexity, we represent the dipole model in terms of effective Coulombic charges, which allows us to study pores of macroscopic lengths in equilibrium with a water bath (or vapor). We find that at ambient conditions, the water chains filling the tube are essentially continuous up to macroscopic dimensions. At reduced water vapor pressure, we observe a 1D Ising-like filling/emptying transition without a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. In the filled state, the chains of water molecules in the tube remain dipole-ordered up to macroscopic lengths of ≈0.1 mm, and the dipolar order is estimated to persist for times up to ≈0.1 s. The observed dipolar order in continuous water chains is a precondition for the use of nanoconfined 1D water as mediator of fast long-range proton transport, e.g., in fuel cells. For water-filled nanotube bundles and membranes, we expect anti-ferroelectric behavior, resulting in a rich phase diagram similar to that of a 2D Coulomb gas.},

The characteristic self-diffusion coefficients D and radial distribution functions, gOO, gOH, and gHH for all five water models were determined and compared to experimental data. The effects of velocity rescaling on the self-diffusion coefficient D were examined. All these empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height of the second peak of the radial distribution function gOO.},

The problematic hydrogen incoherent scattering is removed by a subtraction technique which avoids reference to dynamic models of the liquid. The results, although they show good agreement with computer simulations, show serious qualitative differences with other neutron experiments on water, and it is suggested these discrepancies are a result of lack of attention to the unusual properties of hydrogen as a scatterer of neutrons.},

We propose two complementary theoretical extensions of Marcus theory applying to those cases, based either on a two-Gaussian-states solvation picture, or on a non-Gaussian solvation picture. As illustration, we show that such situations arise even for simple half oxido-reduction reactions involving the Cu+/Cu2+ or Ag0/Ag+ couples, for which electron transfer free-energy surfaces have been generated using first-principle molecular dynamics simulations. The two theoretical extensions are shown to exhibit the correct nonlinear response behavior and to reproduce the simulation results quantitatively, whereas a simple one-Gaussian-state Marcus description breaks down.},

We investigate structural properties including structure factors, pair distribution functions, angular distributions, coordination numbers, and neighbor distributions and compare our results with experimental findings, when available. Most noticeable is the excellent agreement found in the reproduction of the structure in real and reciprocal space which allows tracking the effect of Ge composition on the structure. Ring statistics and ring correlations are examined and followed across the rigidity transition, and the details of typical small rings show a much more complex picture than established previously. A comparison is made with simple bond models and their validity is discussed. Topological constraint analysis is performed and shows that the onset of rigidity changes substantially the angular motion inside the Ge tetrahedra, which displays increased soft bending motions in the stressed rigid phase. We then investigate the vibrational properties via the vibrational density of states and the dielectric function (infrared absorption), and discuss them with respect to experimental findings. Finally, the electronic properties are computed and show an excellent agreement with respect to previous first-principles simulations and to experiments.},

	abstract = {Ordered cubic mesoporous silicas with large pore sizes (LP-SBA-16) have been successfully synthesized at high temperatures (180?220 °C) using polymer surfactant of F127 as a template. Compared with conventional SBA-16 with entrance size at 3.6 nm, LP-SBA-16 samples synthesized at high temperatures show large entrance sizes at 11.8?24.7 nm, confirmed by the pore size distribution and TEM images. The formation of these large pore sizes in the samples is attributed to the increase of surfactant hydrophobicity and the merging of mesopores at high temperatures. The results obtained from NMR and XRD techniques show that ordered mesostructure in LP-SBA-16 samples basically remained even if the surfactant (F127) is fully decomposed at high temperatures, indicating that F127 surfactant becomes unimportant when the mesoporous walls of silica have been condensed. Furthermore, we have compared the adsorption capacity of myoglobin over conventional SBA-16 and LP-SBA-16 samples, and it is found that LP-SBA-16 samples exhibit much higher adsorption capacity than conventional SBA-16, which is potentially important for immobilization of enzymes on ordered mesoporous materials.},

It is possible, simply by formal properties of exponential functions, to generaiize to a great extent the concepts of cumulants and cumulant function. The stochastic variables to be considered need not be ordinary  c -numbers but they may be  q -numbers such as used in quantum mechanics. The exponential function which defines a moment generating function may be any kind of generalized exponential, for example an ordered exponential with a certain prescription for ordering  q -number variables. The definition of average may be greatly generalized as far as the condition is fulfilled that the average of unity is unity. After statements of a few basic theorems these generalizations are discussed here with certain examples of application. This generalized cumulant expansion provides us with a point of view from which many existent methods in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics can be unified.},

	abstract = {Structural disorder at the scale of two to three atomic positions around the probe nucleus results in variations of the EFG and thus in a distribution of the quadrupolar interaction. This distribution is at the origin of the lineshape tailing toward high fields which is often observed in the MAS NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei in disordered solids. The Czjzek model provides an analytical expression for the joint distribution of the NMR quadrupolar parameters υQ and η from which a lineshape can be predicted. This model is derived from the Central Limit Theorem and the statistical isotropy inherent to disorder. It is thus applicable to a wide range of materials as we have illustrated for 27Al spectra on selected examples of glasses (slag), spinels (alumina), and hydrates (cement aluminum hydrates). In particular, when relevant, the use of the Czjzek model allows a quantitative decomposition of the spectra and an accurate extraction of the second moment of the quadrupolar product. In this respect, it is important to realize that only rotational invariants such as the quadrupolar product can make sense to describe the quadrupolar interaction in disordered solids.},

On the basis of thousands of evaporation trajectories, we characterize the members of the transition state ensemble (TSE), which exhibit a liquid?vapor interface with predominantly negative mean curvature at the site of evaporation. We also find that after evaporation is complete, the distributions of translational and angular momenta of the evaporated water are Maxwellian with a temperature equal to that of the liquid. To characterize the evaporation trajectories in their entirety, we find that it suffices to project them onto just two coordinates: the distance of the evaporating molecule to the instantaneous liquid?vapor interface and the velocity of the water along the average interface normal. In this projected space, we find that the TSE is well-captured by a simple model of ballistic escape from a deep potential well, with no additional barrier to evaporation beyond the cohesive strength of the liquid. Equivalently, they are consistent with a near-unity probability for a water molecule impinging upon a liquid droplet to condense. These results agree with previous simulations and with some, but not all, recent experiments.},

Interestingly, the interfacial tension (IFT) of the interfacial system containing a small amount of asphaltene molecules is close to that of a pure heptane?water system, while the IFT of the system containing a large amount of asphaltene molecules is much reduced, ?12 mN/m. Further, it was shown that the reduced IFT results from a complete asphaltene film formed at the oil?water interface when asphaltenes are abundant. In addition, it was found that a small amount of asphaltene molecules stacked their aromatic planes and formed a nanoscale aggregate, which exhibited an exotic molecular oscillation behavior of asphaltene molecules at the oil?water interface.},

One special property is the well known sensitivity to antiferromagnetic spin-density waves due to nesting of the Fermi surface. A second new special property comes from first-principles total-energy calculations on bcc Cr, which show that, although the lowest energy state is nonmagnetic, a small expansion of the lattice brings a second-order transition into a type-I antiferromagnetic phase with rapidly rising local moments. The combined properties provide a mechanism for stabilization of the unusual antiferromagnetic ground state, since a spin-density wave which modulates the moments of the antiferromagnetic phase can be used to compensate the strain energy of the lattice expansion. This combined mechanism also explains various properties of Cr, such as the great sensitivity of the antiferromagnetism to pressure, that are otherwise puzzling.},

The solvation free energy of a complex solute can be obtained by direct minimization of a density functional, instead of the thermodynamic integration scheme necessary when using atomistic simulations. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the expression of the free-energy functional relies on the knowledge of the direct correlation function of the pure solvent. After discussing general molecular solvents, we present a generic density functional describing a dipolar solvent and we show how it can be reduced to the conventional implicit solvent models when the solvent microscopic structure is neglected. With respect to those models, the functional includes additional effects such as the microscopic structure of the solvent, the dipolar saturation effect, and the nonlocal character of the dielectric constant. We also show how this functional can be minimized numerically on a three-dimensional grid around a solute of complex shape to provide, in a single shot, both the average solvent structure and the absolute solvation free energy.},

	doi = {doi:10.1063/1.474664},
	abstract = {Events such as the vibrational relaxation of a solute are often well described by writing an effective equation of motion—a generalized Langevin equation—which expresses the surrounding medium’s influence on the intramolecular dynamics in terms of a friction and a fluctuating force acting on the solute. These quantities, though, can be obtained from the instantaneous normal modes (INMs) of the system when the relaxation takes place in a fluid, suggesting that we should be able to analyze in some detail the solvent motions driving the relaxation, at least for short times. In this paper we show that this promise can indeed be realized for the specific case of a vibrating diatomic molecule dissolved in an atomic solvent. Despite the relatively long times typical of vibrational population relaxation, it turns out that understanding the behavior of the vibrational friction at the short times appropriate to INMs (a few hundred femtoseconds) often suffices to predict T1 times. We use this observation to probe the dependence of these relaxation rates on thermodynamic conditions and to look at the molecular mechanisms underlying the process. We find that raising the temperature at any given density or raising the density at any given temperature will invariably increase the rate of energy relaxation. However, since these two trends may be in conflict in a typical constant-pressure laboratory experiment, we also find that it is possible to make sense of the “anomalous” inverted temperature dependence recently seen experimentally. We find, as well, that the INM theory—which has no explicit collisions built into it—predicts exactly the same density dependence as the venerable independent-binary-collision (IBC) theory (an intriguing result in view of recent claims that experimental observations of this kind of dependence provide support for the IBC theory). The actual mechanisms behind vibrational population relaxation are revealed by looking in detail at the vibrational friction “influence spectrum”—the spectrum of INMs weighted by how efficiently each mode acts to promote the relaxation. Through suitable projections we show that the average influence spectrum is dominated by longitudinal motion of the solvent atoms in the first solvation shell. We go further, however, and examine the nature of the instantaneous relaxation promoted by individual liquid configurations. The number of instantaneous modes that contribute significantly fluctuates strongly from configuration to configuration, and the number of solvent atoms strongly coupled to the solute has a certain amount of variation as well, but invariably each significant mode ends up promoting the relaxation by moving just one or two significant solvent atoms—a feature we explore in a companion paper. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {We present a numerical framework to solve the dynamic model for electrokinetic flows in microchannels using coupled lattice Boltzmann methods. The governing equation for each transport process is solved by a lattice Boltzmann model and the entire process is simulated through an iteration procedure. After validation, the present method is used to study the applicability of the Poisson–Boltzmann model for electrokinetic flows in microchannels. Our results show that for homogeneously charged long channels, the Poisson–Boltzmann model is applicable for a wide range of electric double layer thickness. For the electric potential distribution, the Poisson–Boltzmann model can provide good predictions until the electric double layers fully overlap, meaning that the thickness of the double layer equals the channel width. For the electroosmotic velocity, the Poisson–Boltzmann model is valid even when the thickness of the double layer is 10 times of the channel width. For heterogeneously charged microchannels, a higher zeta potential and an enhanced velocity field may cause the Poisson–Boltzmann model to fail to provide accurate predictions. The ionic diffusion coefficients have little effect on the steady flows for either homogeneously or heterogeneously charged channels. However the ionic valence of solvent has remarkable influences on both the electric potential distribution and the flow velocity even in homogeneously charged microchannels. Both theoretical analyses and numerical results indicate that the valence and the concentration of the counter-ions dominate the Debye length, the electrical potential distribution, and the ions transport. The present results may improve the understanding of the electrokinetic transport characteristics in microchannels.},

	abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has become an indispensable numerical tool to find exact eigenstates of finite-size quantum systems with strong correlation. In the fields of condensed matter, nuclear structure and molecular electronic structure, it has significantly extended the system sizes that can be handled compared to full configuration interaction, without losing numerical accuracy. For quantum chemistry (QC), the most efficient implementations of DMRG require the incorporation of particle number, spin and point group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, as well as the use of so-called complementary operators. The symmetries introduce a sparse block structure in the MPS ansatz and in the intermediary contracted tensors. If a symmetry is non-abelian, the Wigner–Eckart theorem allows to factorize a tensor into a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In addition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these challenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward. Efficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In this work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation of DMRG for ab initio QC. Around CheMPS2, we have implemented the augmented Hessian Newton–Raphson complete active space self-consistent field method, with exact Hessian. The bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the carbon dimer were obtained at the DMRG(28 orbitals, 12 electrons, D SU(2) = 2500 )/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The contribution of 1 s core correlation to the X 1 Σ g + bond dissociation curve of the carbon dimer was estimated by comparing energies at the DMRG(36o, 12e, D SU(2) = 2500 )/cc-pCVDZ and DMRG-SCF(34o, 8e, D SU(2) = 2500 )/cc-pCVDZ levels of theory.

Nature of problem:

The many-body Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of single-particle states. Exact diagonalization solvers can therefore only handle small systems, of up to 18 electrons in 18 orbitals. Interesting active spaces are often significantly larger.

Solution method:

The density matrix renormalization group allows the extension of the size of active spaces, for which numerically exact solutions can be found, to about 40 electrons in 40 orbitals. In addition, it provides a rigorous variational upper bound to energies, as it has an underlying wavefunction ansatz, the matrix product state.

Restrictions:

Our implementation of the density matrix renormalization group is spin-adapted. This means that targeted eigenstates in the active space are exact eigenstates of the total electronic spin operator. Hamiltonians which break this symmetry (a magnetic field term for example) cannot be handled by our code. As electron repulsion integrals in Gaussian basis sets have eightfold permutation symmetry, we have used this property in our code.

Unusual features:

The nature of the matrix product state ansatz allows for exact spin coupling. In CheMPS2, the total electronic spin is imposed (not just the spin projection), in addition to the particle-number and abelian point-group symmetries.

Running time:

The running time depends on the size of the targeted active space, the number of desired eigenstates, their symmetry, the density of states, the individual orbital symmetries, the orbital ordering, the desired level of convergence, and the chosen convergence scheme. To converge a single point of one of the dissociation curves of the carbon dimer ( D ∞ h → D 2 h symmetry) in the cc-pVDZ basis (28 orbitals; their ordering is described in Section  5.3) with 2500 reduced renormalized basis states (see the convergence scheme in Section  5.4; the variational energy then lies 0.1 m E h above the fully converged result) takes about 8 h on a single node with a dual-socket octa-core Intel Xeon Sandy Bridge (E5-2670) (16 cores at 2.6 GHz), and requires 6 GB of RAM.},

The method requires just the structure of protein and the potential energy parameters for the biomolecules and solutions as inputs. The calculation is carried out in two steps. The first step is to obtain the pair correlation functions for solutions consisting of water and ligands based on the RISM theory. Then, given the pair correlation functions prepared in the first step, we calculate the 3D-distribution functions of water and ligands around and inside protein based on the 3D-RISM theory. The molecular recognition of a ligand by the protein is realized by the 3D-distribution functions: if one finds some conspicuous peaks in the distribution of a ligand inside protein, then the ligand is regarded as ?recognized? by the protein. Some biochemical processes are investigated, which are intimately related to the molecular recognition of small ligands including water, noble gases, and ions by a protein.},

In this context, molecular-dynamics simulations have been used to elucidate interatomic processes on microscopic (10-10 m) scales, whereas 'dislocation-dynamics' simulations have explored the long-range elastic interactions between dislocations on mesoscopic (10-6 m) scales. But a quantitative connection between interatomic processes and behaviour on mesoscopic scales has hitherto been lacking. Here we show how such a connection can be made using large-scale (100 million atoms) molecular-dynamics simulations to establish the local rules for mesoscopic simulations of interacting dislocations. In our molecular-dynamics simulations, we observe directly the formation and subsequent destruction of a junction (a Lomer–Cottrell lock) between two dislocations in the plastic zone near a crack tip: the formation of such junctions is an essential process in plastic deformation, as they act as an obstacle to dislocation motion. The force required to destroy this junction is then used to formulate the critical condition for junction destruction in a dislocation-dynamics simulation, the results of which compare well with previous deformation experiments.},

Despite the existence of 60° bond angles in the triangle rings, widely perceived to be energetically unfavorable, the carbon kagome lattice is found to display exceptional stability comparable to that of C60. The system allows us to study the effects of triangular frustration on the electronic properties of realistic solids, and it demonstrates a metal-insulator transition from that of graphene to a direct gap semiconductor in the visible blue region. By minimizing s−p orbital hybridization, which is an intrinsic property of carbon, not only the band edge states become nearly purely frustrated p states, but also the band structure is qualitatively different from any known bulk elemental semiconductors. For example, the optical properties are similar to those of direct-gap semiconductors GaN and ZnO, whereas the effective masses are comparable to or smaller than those of Si.},

	abstract = {We have carried out molecular‐dynamics simulations with holonomic dihedral angle constraints on two models of n‐butane in CCl4 and in water to study the effects of apolar and polar solvents on the g a u c h e‐t r a n s equilibrium. We calculated distributions of conformers from the torsional free‐energy surfaces for each model of butane in both solvents. For a four‐atom model of butane, the g a u c h e‐t r a n sequilibrium constant in either solvent is unchanged relative to its gas‐phase value. For an all‐atom model of butane, the equilibrium population of g a u c h e conformers is increased relative to its gas‐phase value by 14\% and 31\% in CCl4 and water, respectively. The all‐atom results are consistent with the idea of solvophobic stabilization of the g a u c h e conformation. We also computed finite‐difference temperature derivatives of the free energy to determine its energetic and entropic components. The g a u c h e conformer of the four‐atom model is stabilized by entropy and destabilized by energy in CCl4. We find the opposite thermodynamic driving forces for the all‐atom model in CCl4. The g a u c h e conformer is favored entropically and opposed energetically for both models in water. This result supports the idea that the butane hydrophobic effect is a manifestation of the hydrophobic interaction. Average interactionenergies show that changes in solute–solvent interactions contribute significantly to the t r a n s‐g a u c h e internal energy differences in CCl4, while the internal energy differences in water are dominated by changes in the solvent–solvent interactions. Solvent–solute radial distribution functions show that CCl4 packing around the butane molecular is similar to that around other CCl4 molecules, and it is not sensitive to the butane conformation. The water distributions around the butane molecule are very flat, but they show that the water is more disordered around the g a u c h e conformer than the t r a n s.},

We suggest that this migration results from an electrically driven flow field around the polyelectrolyte, which generates additional contributions to the center-of-mass velocity if the overall polymer conformation is asymmetric. This hypothesis leads to a coarse-grained polymer model, without explicit charges, that quantitatively explains the experimentally observed migration. The simulations contradict the widely held notion that charge neutrality eliminates the effects of hydrodynamic interactions in electrically driven flows of polyelectrolytes. We predict a measurable increase in the electrophoretic velocity of a sheared polyelectrolyte that depends on chain length.},

	abstract = {Molecules and assemblies therefrom with strictly vanishing multipolar‐like tensorial susceptibilities of given orders are defined in general, following group theoretical prescriptions. This approach leads, in the case of quadratic nonlinear optical properties, to a new class of molecules with strictly vanishing dipole moments and dipolar components of the quadratic hyperpolarizability tensor β. The remaining nonvanishing irreducible β component, referred to as the octupolar component, had not been previously considered in the perspective of molecular engineering and optimization, as proposed in this work. The adequate tensorial framework for depicting such an approach is derived for the various point‐symmetry classes and a vectorial representation introduced to depict the full anisotropic nature of nonlinear polarizabilities. It permits a more general and adequate scaling of molecules and materials in terms of their efficiencies, while previous molecular classifications, strongly biased by the electric field second‐harmonic (EFISH) solution experiment, focus almost exclusively on the dipolar component of β. Various molecular engineering routes meant at enhancing the octupolar β component are proposed and illustrated by specific examples. The molecular quantum implications of the existence of octupolar nonlinearities are discussed with three‐level systems shown to replace the inadequate traditional two‐level model. Finally, identical tensorial symmetry considerations, applied consistently to molecular assemblies (χ(2)susceptibility) and interacting light beam (F (2) cubic field tensor) evidence the relevance of circularly polarized beams to probe octupolar assemblies, the ellipticity of the outgoing beam in the case of second‐harmonic generation depending on the ratio of the octupolar over dipolar susceptibility components.},

	abstract = {A general overview of the optoelectronic properties of π-conjugated polymers is presented. Two types of polymer are discerned: interchangeable structures of the same energy (degenerate), such as polyacetylene; and non-degenerate polymers, such as poly(para-phenylene). The band structures of degenerate and non-degenerate polymers are related to their conductivities in doped and non-doped states. In both cases, disorder and impurities play an important role in conductivity. Polarons, bipolarons and excitons are detailed with respect to doping and charge transfers. Given the fibrillic nature of these materials, the variable range hopping (VRH) law for semiconducting polymers is modified to account for metallic behaviours. Optoelectronic properties—electroluminescence and photovoltaic activity—are explained in terms of HOMO and LUMO bands, polaron-exciton and charge movement over one or more molecules. The properties of H- or J-type aggregates and their effects on transitions are related to target applications. Device structures of polymer light-emitting diodes are explicitly linked to optimising polaron recombinations and overall quantum efficiencies. The particularly promising use of π-conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices is discussed. Copyright © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry},

This was initially due to their advantageous physical and chemical properties: good heat transfer capacity, radiation insensitivity, high boiling point, wide range solubility for actinides. In addition it was realised that molten salts could be used in numerous situations: high temperature heat transfer, core coolants with solid fuels, liquid fuel in a molten salt reactor, solvents for spent nuclear solid fuel in the case of pyro-reprocessing and coolant and tritium production in the case of fusion. Molten salt reactors, one of the six innovative concepts chosen by the Generation IV international forum, are particularly interesting for use as either waste incinerators or thorium cycle systems. As the neutron balance in the thorium cycle is very tight, the possibility to perform online extraction of some fission product poisons from the salt is very attractive. In this article the most important questions that must be addressed to demonstrate the feasibility of molten salt reactor will be reviewed.},

Further, modified Coulomb potentials and periodic boundary conditions can easily be integrated. One possible application is rapid, yet detailed methodological studies of the effects resulting from the various modified electrostatic interactions that are used regularly in computer simulations with explicit solvent molecules. As an example, we report the distance dependent Kirkwood g-factor and ion–dipole correlation functions of a solvated glycine zwitterion obtained with a simple cutoff, a shifted potential, two reaction field techniques, and Ewald summation.

We also discuss some simple practical ways to use this information to predict confined hard-sphere fluid behavior in different rough-wall systems.},

For 2H, where the qcc shift is due mostly to the change in O–H bond length, excellent agreement with the experimental vapor → ice shift was obtained. For 17O, the change in the qcc is found to be mainly electronic in origin, effectively due to the polarization of the charge associated with the oxygen atom, and approximately 75\% of the observed qcc shift was reproduced. On the basis of the calculations, estimates of the 17O and 2H qcc’s in liquid water were made that are consistent with the values obtained from an analysis of the available NMR relaxation data, provided that librational motions are properly taken into account. We also present results of SCF calculations on water interacting with a Li+, Na+, or Cl− ion, indicating that the effect of a nearby ion on the 2H and 17O qcc’s is similar to that produced by H bonding.},

Structural aspects of the hydration of aniline and benzoic acid in water were studied with 1D- and 3D-RISM integral equation methods. Analysis of the structural data reveals that the first hydration shell of aniline consists of {\textasciitilde} 26 water molecules, whereas benzoic acid is hydrated by 28.4 H2O. For aqueous aniline the average number of water molecules surrounding the –NH2 group is 6.7 and on average {\textasciitilde} 1.8 H-bonds are formed by the amino group. In aqueous benzoic acid the hydration shell of the –COOH group consists of 6.3 water molecules surrounding the carbonyl oxygen and of 6.1 water molecules around the hydroxyl group. The average number of H-bonds formed by the carboxylic group is 2.85. For both systems water molecules are preferably located above and below the plane defined by the phenyl ring at a distance of {\textasciitilde} 0.3 nm from the ring center. The number of the π-coordinated water molecules is 1.16 for aniline and 1.2 for benzoic acid. It was found, that the π-region of aniline is more H-bonded with water than the π-region of benzoic acid.},

Nevertheless, in numerous if not all practical situations, transport is confined by walls where adsorption and desorption processes may occur. In this article, we derive explicitly the expression of the time-dependent diffusion coefficient between two confining walls in the presence of adsorption and desorption. We show that they strongly modify the time-dependency of the diffusion coefficient, even in this simple geometry.

The flexible SPC water model is used as the solvent, while the ions are treated as charged Lennard-Jones particles. Only a weak influence of the salt concentration is found on the ion?ion pair correlation functions. The structures of the hydrated shells around ion pairs are studied using three-body correlation functions. The self-diffusion and interdiffusion coefficients are found to decrease with an increase of salt concentration. Molar conductivities are calculated at different salt concentrations.

NPT-Monte Carlo simulations were performed at room conditions using the TIP5P model potential for water and united-atoms (OPLS) for methanol to generate the H-bond networks. We have found evidence for non-ideal behavior of mixtures with x(m) ≈ 0.3. Several structural and topological properties present strong dependence with the mixture composition. Island statistics indicate a change from the percolated to non-percolate regime at x(m) ≈ 0.5. Statistical analysis of the islands' nature (homo-clusters: same type of molecules × hetero-clusters: two types of molecules) yields a preferential formation of homo-clusters that quantifies the local composition and preferential solvation ("microimmiscibility"). The topology of the hydrogen bond networks was characterized by local (clustering coefficients, average degrees), semi-global (path lengths) and global (spectral densities) properties. Small-world patterns (highly clustered and small path lengths) appear for x(m) in the range 0.40-0.70, and the momenta in the spectral densities correlate quite well with previous analysis based on rings, chains and branched chains topologies. It also seems that small quantities of methanol in water cause disruption of the continuous fully connected H-bond networks formed by water molecules.},

	abstract = {The deuterium quadrupole coupling constant and asymmetry parameter in heavy water were determined using ab initio SCF calculations. Snapshots from a molecular dynamics simulation were used to give liquid water cluster configurations and the influence of simulation parameters on the quadrupole coupling constant was investigated. The electronic potential model and the number of molecules in the molecular dynamics simulation and the pressure of the system were found to have only a small influence on the quadrupole coupling constant. The average value of the quadrupole coupling constant at room temperature, corrected for the known deficiency of the ab initio calculation in the gas phase, yields a quadrupole coupling constant of 253 kHz, in perfect agreement with the most recent experiments. The oxygen—deuterium bond lengths in ice Ih, ice II, and ice IX were determined using experimental quadrupole coupling constants and a model equation. An averaged bond length of 98.9 pm was obtained for the Ih form, which is approximately 2 pm shorter than that determined by neutron diffraction studies, whereas the bond lengths for the four deuterium sites in ice II and the three sites in ice IX are in fair agreement with experiment. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Mixture simulations with lithium salt mole fractions between 0\% and 33\% at 363 and 423 K yield densities, ion self-diffusion coefficients, and ionic conductivities in very good agreement with available experimental data. In all investigated electrolytes, each Li+ cation was found to be coordinated, on average, by 4.1 oxygen atoms from surrounding anions. At lower concentrations (x ≤ 0.20), the Li+ cation was found to be, on average, coordinated by slightly more than three Ntf2 anions with two anions contributing a single oxygen atom and one anion contributing two oxygen atoms to Li+ coordination. At the highest [Li][Ntf2] concentration, however, there were, on average, 3.5 anions coordinating each Li+ cation, corresponding to fewer bidendate and more monodentate anions in the Li+ coordination sphere. This trend is due to increased sharing of anions by Li+ at higher salt concentrations. In the [pyr13][Ntf2]/[Li][Ntf2] electrolytes, the ion diffusivity is significantly smaller than that in organic liquid electrolytes due to not only the greater viscosity of the solvent but also the formation of clusters resulting from sharing of anions by Li+ cations. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes was found to decrease with increasing salt concentration, with the effect being greater at the higher temperature. Finally, we found that the contribution of Li+ to ionic conductivity does not increase proportionally to Li+ concentration but saturates at higher doping levels.},

Previously a uniform charging method was shown to reduce the grid dependence substantially over the point charge model used in commercially available codes. In this article we demonstrate that smoothing the charge and dielectric values on the grid can improve the grid independence, as measured by the spread of calculated values, by another order of magnitude. Calculations of Born ion solvation energies, small molecule solvation energies, the electrostatic field of superoxide dismutase, and protein-protein binding energies are used to demonstrate that this method yields the same results as the point charge model while reducing the positional errors by several orders of magnitude. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present a general overview of the organization of colloidal charged clay particles in aqueous suspension by studying different natural samples with different structural charges and charge locations. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments (SAXS) are first used to derive swelling laws that demonstrate the almost perfect exfoliation of clay sheets in suspension. Using a simple approach based on geometrical constraints, we show that these swelling laws can be fully modeled on the basis of morphological parameters only. The validity of this approach was further extended to other clay data from the literature, in particular, synthetic Laponite. For all of the investigated samples, experimental osmotic pressures can be properly described by a Poisson?Boltzmann approach for ionic strength up to 10?3 M, which reveals that these systems are dominated by repulsive electrostatic interactions. However, a detailed analysis of the Poisson?Boltzmann treatment shows differences in the repulsive potential strength that are not directly linked to the structural charge of the minerals but rather to the charge location in the structure for tetrahedrally charged clays (beidellite and nontronites) undergoing stronger electrostatic repulsions than octahedrally charged samples (montmorillonites, laponite). Only minerals subjected to the strongest electrostatic repulsions present a true isotropic to nematic phase transition in their phase diagrams. The influence of ionic repulsions on the local order of clay platelets was then analyzed through a detailed investigation of the structure factors of the various clay samples. It appears that stronger electrostatic repulsions improve the liquidlike positional local order.},

The free energy per unit surface area to form empty volumes (i.e., cavities) is a rapidly varying function of the radius for small cavities. It becomes constant for large volumes. The source of these behaviors is the occurrence of drying (i.e., solvent depletion) at the cavity surface. The crossover to drying occurs on microscopic length scales, with significant density depletion found for cavities with radii of the order of two or more Lennard-Jones diameters.

La compréhension des phénomènes microscopiques à l'origine de cette augmentation de capacité est l'objet de cette thèse. Nous utilisons la dynamique moléculaire pour simuler des supercondensateurs modèles. Nos simulations présentent des caractéristiques originales : nous représentons l'électrolyte par un modèle gros grains, les électrodes par une structure poreuse complexe, et nous maintenons ces électrodes à un potentiel électrique constant. À partir de nos simulations, nous avons montré que l'augmentation de capacité dans les carbones poreux est le résultat d'une modification importante de la structure du liquide à l'interface avec l'électrode. Plus précisément, le confinement empêche la formation de couches successives de liquide qui ont tendance à diminuer l'efficacité du stockage de charge. Nous présentons également plusieurs méthodes de détermination de la capacité par dynamique moléculaire. L'utilisation d'une structure poreuse complexe et l'inclusion de la polarisation des électrodes nous permettent de caractériser finement la corrélation entre le confinement et l'efficacité du stockage de charge. Enfin, nous étudions les phénomènes dynamiques survenant au sein des supercondensateurs, cette dernière partie permettant d'envisager dans le futur une caractérisation de la puissance des supercondensateurs par dynamique moléculaire.},

These results cannot be explained in terms of the classical Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which only considers two types of forces: the electrical double-layer repulsion and the London–van der Waals attraction. Although there is a controversy about the origin of the short-range repulsive force, the existence of a structured layer of water molecules at the silicasurface is the most accepted explanation for it. The overlap of structured water layers of different surfaces leads to repulsive forces, which are known as hydration forces. This assumption is based on the very hydrophilic nature of silica. Different theories have been developed in order to reproduce the exponentially decaying behavior (as a function of the separation distance) of the hydration forces. Different mechanisms for the formation of the structured water layer around the silicasurfaces are considered by each theory. By the aid of an AFM and the colloid probe technique, the interaction forces between silicasurfaces have been measured directly at different p H values and salt concentrations. The results confirm the presence of the short-range repulsion at any experimental condition (even at high salt concentration). A comparison between the experimental data and theoretical fits obtained from different theories has been performed in order to elucidate the nature of this non-DLVO repulsive force.},

	abstract = {The molecular dynamics computer simulation technique is used to develop a rigid, four-site polarizable model for water. The suggested model reasonably describes the important properties of water clusters, the thermodynamic and structural properties of the liquid and the liquid/vapor interface of water. The minimum energy configurations and the binding energies for these clusters are in reasonable agreement with accurate electronic structure calculations. The model predicts that the water trimer, tetramer, and pentamer have cyclic planar minimum energy structures. A prismlike structure is predicted to be lowest in energy for the water hexamer, and a cagelike structure is the second lowest in energy, with an energy of about 0.2 kcal/mol higher than the prismlike structure. The results are consistent with recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations as well as electronic structure calculations. The computed thermodynamic properties for the model, at room temperature, including the liquid density, the enthalpy of vaporization, as well as the diffusion coefficient, are in excellent agreement with experimental values. Structural properties of liquid water, such as the radial distribution functions, neutron, and x-ray scattering intensities, were calculated and critically evaluated against the experimental measurements. In all cases, we found the agreement between the observed data and the computed properties to be quite reasonable. The computed density profile of the water’s liquid/vapor interface shows that the interface is not sharp at a microscopic level and has a thickness of 3.2 Å at 298 K. These results are consistent with those reported in earlier work on the same systems. The calculated surface tension at room temperature is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data. As expected, the computed average dipole moments of water molecules near the interface are close to their gas phase values, while water molecules far from the interface have dipole moments corresponding to their bulk values. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity. Amino acid chromatographic analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the THF contained little or no protein, yet it produced 3.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C of TH at 5 mg/ml, comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins. Compositional and structural analyses indicated that this antifreeze contains a beta-mannopyranosyl-(1--{\textgreater}4) beta-xylopyranose backbone and a fatty acid component, although the lipid may not be covalently linked to the saccharide. Consistent with the proposed structure, treatment with endo-beta-(1--{\textgreater}4)xylanase ablated TH activity. This xylomannan is the first TH-producing antifreeze isolated from a freeze-tolerant animal and the first in a new class of highly active THFs that contain little or no protein.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are a new phase of matter, with the striking property that conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces. In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves. One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties. Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external magnetic field. But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic topological insulators with scatter-free edge states requires a fundamentally different mechanism—one that is free of magnetic fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put forward recently. One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states. This is in the spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators, in which temporal variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields and with scatter-free edge transport—a photonic lattice exhibiting topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides arranged in a graphene-like honeycomb lattice. Paraxial diffraction of light is described by a Schrodinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts as /`time/'. Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.},

A detailed comparison is made with measurements of the electronic specific heat, with neutron-scattering results for the moments of the impurity and the neighboring host atoms, and with magnetization measurements. Contrary to the case of Co and Ni alloys, the majority-spin band contributes most to the screening in the Fe alloys. This arises from the fact that the Fermi energy falls into the minimum of the minority-spin density of states. The results are in qualitative agreement with a proposed pseudogap theory and naturally explain why Fe alloys show such a complicated magnetic behavior.},

For the latter case, the formation energy of the alloy is strictly positive smooth function of chromium concentration, in agreement with experiments performed at high temperature.

Based on cell theory, it approximates the potential energy surface sampled in the simulation by an anisotropic six-dimensional harmonic potential to model the three hindered translations and three hindered rotations of a single rigid water molecule. The potential is parametrized from the magnitude of the forces and torques measured in the simulation. The entropy of these six harmonic oscillators is calculated and summed with a conformational term to give the total entropy. Combining this with the simulation enthalpy yields the free energy. The six water models examined are TIP3P, SPC, TIP4P, SPC/E, TIP5P, and TIP4P-Ew. The results reproduce experiment well: free energies for all models are within 1.6 kJ mol−1 and entropies are within 3.6 J K−1 mol−1. Approximately two-thirds of the entropy comes from translation, a third from rotation, and 5\% from conformation. Vibrational frequencies match those in the experimental infrared spectrum and assist in their assignment. Intermolecular quantum effects are found to be small, with free energies for the classical oscillator lying 0.5–0.7 kJ mol−1 higher than in the quantum case. Molecular displacements and vibrational and zero point energies are also calculated. Altogether, these results validate the harmonic oscillator as a quantitative model for the liquid state.},

We show that the uncertainties of the microscopic parameters of, in particular, sodium, and, to a lesser extent, chloride, translate into large differences in the computed radial-distribution functions. This uncertainty reflect the incomplete experimental knowledge of the structural properties of ionic aqueous solutions at finite molarity. We discuss possible implications on the computation of potential of mean force and effective potentials.},

	abstract = {Protein hydration shell dynamics play an important role in biochemical processes including protein folding, enzyme function, and molecular recognition. We present here a comparison of the reorientation dynamics of individual water molecules within the hydration shell of a series of globular proteins: acetylcholinesterase, subtilisin Carlsberg, lysozyme, and ubiquitin. Molecular dynamics simulations and analytical models are used to access site-resolved information on hydration shell dynamics and to elucidate the molecular origins of the dynamical perturbation of hydration shell water relative to bulk water. We show that all four proteins have very similar hydration shell dynamics, despite their wide range of sizes and functions, and differing secondary structures. We demonstrate that this arises from the similar local surface topology and surface chemical composition of the four proteins, and that such local factors alone are sufficient to rationalize the hydration shell dynamics. We propose that these conclusions can be generalized to a wide range of globular proteins. We also show that protein conformational fluctuations induce a dynamical heterogeneity within the hydration layer. We finally address the effect of confinement on hydration shell dynamics via a site-resolved analysis and connect our results to experiments via the calculation of two-dimensional infrared spectra.},

	abstract = {Water molecules confined to pores with sub-nanometre diameters form single-file hydrogen-bonded chains. In such nanoscale confinement, water has unusual physical properties that are exploited in biology and hold promise for a wide range of biomimetic and nanotechnological applications. The latter can be realized by carbon and boron nitride nanotubes which confine water in a relatively non-specific way and lend themselves to the study of intrinsic properties of single-file water. As a consequence of strong water–water hydrogen bonds, many characteristics of single-file water are conserved in biological and synthetic pores despite differences in their atomistic structures. Charge transport and orientational order in water chains depend sensitively on and are mainly determined by electrostatic effects. Thus, mimicking functions of biological pores with apolar pores and corresponding external fields gives insight into the structure–function relation of biological pores and allows the development of technical applications beyond the molecular devices found in living systems. In this Perspective, we revisit results for single-file water in apolar pores, and examine the similarities and the differences between these simple systems and water in more complex pores.},

The nuclear coordinate space is spanned by the torsion, the C–C stretch coordinate, the left and right pyramidalization and the symmetric and antisymmetric scissor coordinates. The C–H stretch coordinates and the CH 2 rocking angles are kept frozen at their ground-state equilibrium value. A diabatic representation of the valence states of ethene has been constructed within the framework of a Hückel-type model. The diabatic potential-energy elements are represented as analytic functions of the relevant coordinates. The parameters of the analytic functions have been determined by a least-squares fit of the eigenvalues of the diabatic potential-energy matrix to the ab initio data for one-dimensional and two-dimensional cuts of the six-dimensional surface. As a function of the torsion, the analytic potential-energysurface describes the intersections of the V and Z states for torsional angles near 90°, which are converted into conical intersections by the antisymmetric scissor mode. As a function of pyramidalization of perpendicular ethene, it describes the intersections of the diabatic N and Z states, which are converted into conical intersections by displacements in the torsional mode. The analytic potential-energysurfaces can provide the basis for a quantum wave packet description of the internal conversion of photoexcited ethene to the electronic ground state via conical intersections.},

The LLCP is believed to be the end point of the coexistence line between a high density liquid (HDL) and a low density liquid (LDL) phase of water. In the present paper we study the different features of water?water structure in HDL and LDL both in bulk water and in the solution. We find that the ions are able to modify the bulk LDL structure, rendering water?water structure more similar to the bulk HDL case. By the study of the hydration structure in HDL and LDL, a possible mechanism for the modification of the bulk LDL structure in the solution is identified in the substitution of the oxygen by the chloride ion in oxygen coordination shells.},

	abstract = {The ability of the most popular models of methanol (H1, OPLS, L2, and L1) for the prediction of the solid-solid and the solid-fluid equilibria was analyzed in detail in this work by using molecular simulation. The three solid phases (α, β, and γ) detected experimentally as being thermodynamically stable, as well as the fluid phase, were considered for the calculations. It turns out that all the models provide similar results. The α, γ, and fluid phases were found to be thermodynamically stable for a certain range of temperatures and pressures, whereas the β phase was always metastable. The coexistence curves (α-fluid, α-γ, γ-fluid) corresponding to all the models took the same shape except for some slight differences about their locations. From a qualitative point of view, it can be considered that the four models give a reasonable prediction of the phase diagram of methanol. However, there are important quantitative discrepancies. The melting points fell in the interval 214-223 K, whereas the γ phase was predicted to be stable at pressures above 12 × 10(4) bar. These results are quite different in relation to the experiments since the melting point of methanol is 175.6 K and the γ phase is stable at 3.5 × 10(4) bar at room temperature. In addition, the values of the melting enthalpy obtained by the different models are very similar but about 50\% higher than the experimental value. Therefore, it is clear that there is room for improvement. Reducing the stability of the α phase with respect to the other phases seems to be a necessary condition to construct an improved potential.},

Then, we discuss the interplay between the microscopic structure of the molten salts and their dynamic properties. It is often considered that variations in the diffusion coefficient of the anions are mainly driven by the evolution of its coordination with the metallic ion (Y3+ here). We compare this system with fluorozirconate melts and demonstrate that the coordination number is a poor indicator of the evolution of the diffusion coefficient. Instead, we propose to use the ionic bonds lifetime. We show that the weak Y–F ionic bonds in LiF–YF3 do not induce the expected tendency of the fluoride diffusion coefficient to converge toward one of the yttrium cation when the content in YF3 increases. Implications on the validity of the Nernst-Einstein relation for estimating the electrical conductivity are discussed.},

The Picard iteration, that is often employed, is very simple and robust but can be rather slow. While a number of different algorithms for optimization problems have been suggested, there is still great need for additional strategies. Here, we present an approach based on the limited memory Broyden algorithm that is efficient and relatively simple to implement. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with the minimization of an inhomogeneous bulk structure of a fluid with competing interactions. For the problems we studied, we find that the presented algorithm improves performance by roughly a factor of three.},

	abstract = {We describe an automated procedure for protein design, implemented in a flexible software package, called Proteus. System setup and calculation of an energy matrix are done with the XPLOR modeling program and its sophisticated command language, supporting several force fields and solvent models. A second program provides algorithms to search sequence space. It allows a decomposition of the system into groups, which can be combined in different ways in the energy function, for both positive and negative design. The whole procedure can be controlled by editing 2–4 scripts. Two applications consider the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme and its successful redesign to bind both O-methyl-tyrosine and D-tyrosine. For the latter, we present Monte Carlo simulations where the D-tyrosine concentration is gradually increased, displacing L-tyrosine from the binding pocket and yielding the binding free energy difference, in good agreement with experiment. Complete redesign of the Crk SH3 domain is presented. The top 10000 sequences are all assigned to the correct fold by the SUPERFAMILY library of Hidden Markov Models. Finally, we report the acid/base behavior of the SNase protein. Sidechain protonation is treated as a form of mutation; it is then straightforward to perform constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations, which yield good agreement with experiment. Overall, the software can be used for a wide range of application, producing not only native-like sequences but also thermodynamic properties with errors that appear comparable to other current software packages.Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, subtle deviations from linearity reflect the concentration dependence of the individual iron and chromium moments, which is presented in part II. The concentration dependence of the moments can be approximately reproduced by existing coherent-potential-approximation calculations.},

It was shown previously that the core-softened fluid under study is characterized by a set of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic anomalies. The principal objective of this work was to elucidate how the presence of ions alters this behavior. The structural properties of the mixtures are discussed in terms of the pair distribution functions; in addition, the pair contribution to the excess entropy was calculated. Thermodynamic properties are investigated by using the dependencies of energy and compressibility factor on density, composition of the mixture, and reduced temperature. The heat capacity was also evaluated. Our principal findings concern the description of structural anomalies in the mixture, the dependence of the temperature of maximum density on the ionic concentration, and establishing the regions delimiting the structural and thermodynamic anomalies of the model mixture.},

For films thinner than ∼2 nm oscillatory structural forces are observed as the surface separation decreases and pairs of ion layers are squeezed out of the film. Strikingly, measurements of the shear stress of the ionic liquid film reveal low friction coefficients which are 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than for analogous films of non-polar molecular liquids, including standard hydrocarbon lubricants, up to ca. 1 MPa pressure. We attribute this to the geometric and charge characteristics of the ionic liquid: the irregular shapes of the ions lead to a low shear stress, while the strong coulombic interactions between the ions and the charged confining surfaces lead to a robust film which is maintained between the shearing surfaces when pressure is applied across the film.},

The field theory is based on separation of fields into short- and long-wavelength terms, which are subjected to different statistical-mechanical treatments. The simulations were performed by using a new, accurate, and fast algorithm for numerical evaluation of the electrostatic polarization interaction. The field theory provides counterion distributions outside a macroion in good agreement with the simulation results over the full range from weak to strong electrostatic coupling. A low-dielectric macroion leads to a displacement of the counterions away from the macroion.},

	abstract = {The quantum mechanical SMD continuum universal solvation model can be applied to predict the free energy of solvation of any solute in any solvent following specification of various macroscopic solvent parameters. For three ionic liquids where these descriptors are readily available, the SMD solvation model exhibits a mean unsigned error of 0.48 kcal/mol for 93 solvation free energies of neutral solutes and a mean unsigned error of 1.10 kcal/mol for 148 water-to-IL transfer free energies. Because the necessary solvent parameters are not always available for a given ionic liquid, we determine average values for a set of ionic liquids over which measurements have been made in order to define a generic ionic liquid solvation model, SMD-GIL. Considering 11 different ionic liquids, the SMD-GIL solvation model exhibits a mean unsigned error of 0.43 kcal/mol for 344 solvation free energies of neutral solutes and a mean unsigned error of 0.61 kcal/mol for 431 water-to-IL transfer free energies. As these errors are similar in magnitude to those typically observed when applying continuum solvation models to ordinary liquids, we conclude that the SMD universal solvation model may be applied to ionic liquids as well as ordinary liquids.},

This ‘‘first-principles,’’ Landau-type approach attempts to treat several contributions (electronic structure, Fermi surface, electrostatics, magnetism, etc.) to the electronic energy on an equal footing. An important ingredient for the statistical averaging is the replacement of the molecular mean fields (Weiss fields) with Onsager cavity fields, which forces the diagonal part of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to be obeyed. To show its general applicability and usefulness, we apply the theory to three fcc alloy systems. In Cu0.75Pd0.25, the incommensurate atomic short-range order is driven by a Fermi-surface effect, in agreement with earlier work. In contrast, Pd0.5Rh0.5 exhibits clustering tendencies, with both band-filling and charge-rearrangement effects being important in setting the spinodal temperature at 1150 K, in good agreement with experiment. In the final examples of three nickel-rich NiCr alloys, previously ignored electrostatic effects are found to play a significant role in determining the atomic short-range order.},

The pair interactions are fitted on ab initio calculations of mixing energies and vacancy migration barriers at 0 K. The entropic contributions to the mixing of Fe-Cr alloys and to the vacancy formation and migration free energies are taken into account. The model reproduces the change in sign of the mixing energy with the alloy composition and gives realistic thermodynamic and kinetic properties, including an asymmetrical miscibility gap at low temperature and diffusion coefficients in good agreement with available experimental data. Simulations of short-range ordering and α-α′ decomposition are performed at 773 and 813 K for Cr concentrations between 10\% and 50\%. They are compared with experimental kinetics based on three-dimensional atom probe and neutron scattering measurements. The possible effect of magnetic properties on diffusion in the α and α′ phases, and therefore on the decomposition kinetics, is emphasized.},

	abstract = {In the implicit solvent models of electrolytes (such as the primitive model (PM)), the ions are modeled as point charges in the centers of spheres (hard spheres in the case of the PM). The surfaces of the spheres are not polarizable which makes these models appropriate to use in computer simulations of electrolyte systems where these ions do not leave their host dielectrics. The same assumption makes them inappropriate in simulations where these ions cross dielectric boundaries because the interaction energy of the point charge with the polarization charge induced on the dielectric boundary diverges. In this paper, we propose a procedure to treat the passage of such ions through dielectric interfaces with an interpolation method. Inspired by the “bubble ion” model (in which the ion's surface is polarizable), we define a space-dependent effective dielectric coefficient, ε eff (r), for the ion that overlaps with the dielectric boundary. Then, we replace the “bubble ion” with a point charge that has an effective charge q/ε eff (r) and remove the portion of the dielectric boundary where the ion overlaps with it. We implement the interpolation procedure using the induced charge computation method [D. Boda, D. Gillespie, W. Nonner, D. Henderson, and B. Eisenberg, Phys. Rev. E 69, 046702 (2004)]. We analyze the various energy terms using a spherical ion passing through an infinite flat dielectric boundary as an example.},

We discuss more specifically the insights gained from molecular simulations into the acidity of surface edge sites, ion exchange and the behaviour of clay interlayers in contact with a CO2 reservoir. On the other hand, upscaling the descriptions from the molecular level to the macroscopic scale without forgetting the fundamental role of interfaces on the mesoscopic scale provides a means to capture complex phenomena such as electrokinetic couplings. We illustrate the complementarity of molecular dynamics, lattice-based mesoscopic simulations and Pore Network Models to address this issue.},

	abstract = {Physicochemical transport due to electro-osmosis of dilute electrolyte solutions ({\textless}1 × 10−3 mol/L) through microporous media with granular random microstructures has been modeled in this work by our three-step numerical framework. First, the three-dimensional microstructures of porous media are reproduced by a random generation growth method. Second, the effects of chemical adsorption and electrical dissociation at the solid-liquid interfaces are modeled to determine the electrical boundary conditions, which vary with the ionic concentration, pH, and temperature. Finally, the nonlinear governing equations for electrokinetic transport are solved using a highly efficient lattice Poisson-Boltzmann algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the electro-osmotic permeability through the granular microporous media increases monotonically with the porosity, ionic concentration, pH, and temperature. When the surface electric potential is higher than about −50 mV, the electro-osmotic permeability exponentially increases with the electric potential. The electro-osmotic permeability increases with the bulk ionic concentration even though the surface zeta potential decreases correspondingly, which deviates from the conclusions based on the thin layer model. The electro-osmotic permeability increases exponentially with pH and linearly with temperature. The present modeling results improve our understanding of hydrodynamic and electrokinetic transport in geophysical systems and help guide the design of porous electrodes in microenergy systems.},

This implicit solvent method allows for the determination of structural, orientational, and energetic solvation properties that are on a par with all-atom molecular simulations performed for the same system, while reducing the computer time by two orders of magnitude. This is illustrated by the study of an atomistically-resolved clay surface composed of over a thousand atoms wetted by a molecular dipolar solvent. The high numerical efficiency of the method is exploited to carry a systematic analysis of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the surface-solvent interaction within the popular Clay Force Field (CLAYFF). Solvent energetics and structure are found to depend weakly upon the atomic charges distribution of the clay surface, even for a rather polar solvent. We conclude on the consequences of such findings for force-field development.},

	abstract = {The cause of the so-called 475℃ brittleness of a high chromium steel has not yet been determined. To study this phenomenon, the hardness, thermal expansion, electric resistance, thermal magnetic analysis, tensile test and microstructure of high chromium steels containing 15〜35 per cent of chromium were observed. When high chromium steels were heated at about 500℃, expansion is observed, and the hardness and tensile strength increased, whereas the reduction of area, elongation, electric resistance and intensity of magnetization decreased, and the magnetic transformation point shifted toward higher temperatures with the time. Clear difference in microstructure was not seen between the specimens annealed for many hours at about 500℃ and those annealed not so long, the former showing clear grain boundary etching. From these experimental results, it was concluded that this phenomenon was not caused by the usual precipitation but by the formation of a superlattice.},

Accurate NMR tensors, electric field gradient (EFG) and chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) are calculated from density functional theory (DFT) within the well-established PAW/GIPAW framework. The theoretical results are compared to experimental high-resolution solid-state NMR data and are used to validate the considered structural model. The distributions of the calculated coupling constant CQ ∝ {\textbar}Vzz{\textbar} and the asymmetry parameter ηQ that characterize the quadrupolar interaction are discussed in terms of structural considerations with the help of a simple point charge model. Finally, the ECM analysis is shown to be relevant for studying the distribution of CSA tensor parameters and gives new insight into the structural characterization of disordered systems by solid-state NMR.},

Li adsorption forms a strong Coulomb interaction with Ti3C2-based hosts but well preserves its structural integrity. The bare Ti3C2 monolayer exhibits a low barrier for Li diffusion and high Li storage capacity (up to Ti3C2Li2 stoichiometry). The surface functionalization of F and OH blocks Li transport and decreases Li storage capacity, which should be avoided in experiments. The exceptional properties, including good electronic conductivity, fast Li diffusion, low operating voltage, and high theoretical Li storage capacity, make Ti3C2 MXene a promising anode material for Li ion batteries.},

As yet there is no microscopic theory to describe their surprisingly large capacitance per unit volume (volumetric capacitance) of {\textasciitilde}100 F/cm3, nor is there a good understanding of the fundamental limits on volumetric capacitance. In this paper we present a non-mean-field theory of the volumetric capacitance of a supercapacitor that captures the discrete nature of the ions and the exponential screening of their repulsive interaction by the electrode. We consider analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations the case of an electrode made from a good metal and show that in this case the volumetric capacitance can reach the record values. We also study how the capacitance is reduced when the electrode is an imperfect metal characterized by some finite screening radius. Finally, we argue that a carbon electrode, despite its relatively large linear screening radius, can be approximated as a perfect metal because of its strong nonlinear screening. In this way the experimentally measured capacitance values of {\textasciitilde}100 F/cm3 may be understood.},

In the monolayer regime, three different adsorbed amounts corresponding to increasing fillings of the interlayer space were investigated whereas two situations (adsorption and desorption) were investigated in the bilayer region. In a first step, molecular dynamics were used to reexamine some of the approximations classically used in the analysis of water motion by QENS (i.e., separation between rotational and translational diffusion, preferred orientation of molecules, and contribution to the elastic incoherent structure factor). A careful analysis of experimental data obtained at two wavelengths and for two orientations of the clay platelets and validated by simulations yielded rotational and translational movements of water molecules in the clay interlayer. Two rotational movements at two different time scales are revealed. The faster one is rather independent of the adsorbed water amount whereas the slower one assigned to the rotation of hydrated cations is significantly slowed down in the monolayer regime, especially upon completion of the first water layer. Translational movements are limited in the longitudinal direction and are significantly slower than in bulk water in the radial direction, even in the bilayer regime.},

In addition, our previous work has shown that the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid can be rigorously and usefully explained in terms of vibrational excitations within, and shifting equilibrium between, these stable molecular packings. Previously, we have determined transition rates between various packings as a function of temperature, system size, and extent of supercooling. In the present work, we study the effect of density on both the number and distribution of packing structures. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for systems of 32 and 108 argon‐like particles at three densities. The primary obsrvations and conclusions are: (1) as the density decreases the total number of different amorphous packing structures increases; (2) the density at which the amorphous material has its minimal average energy is about 3\% lower than the density at which the crystalline material has its minimal energy; (3) the activation energy to self‐diffusion is found to increase with increasing density.},

Many different methods are already known, but development is still at prototype stage. Here I report a novel method, based on electric double-layer capacitor technology. Two porous electrodes, immersed in the salt solution, constitute a capacitor. It is first charged, then the salt solution is brought into contact with fresh water. The electrostatic energy increases as the salt concentration of the solution is reduced due to diffusion. This device can be used to turn sources of salinity difference into completely renewable sources of energy. An experimental demonstration is given, and performances and possible improvements are discussed.},

	abstract = {The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schrödinger equation is a ‘non-polynomial hard’ problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, electron–electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods—based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate—have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the ‘gold standard’ coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle–hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state problems.

The positions of the first two triplet states agreed with optical data on solid benzene and threshold electron‐impact experiments. The third triplet state at 5.6 eV was assigned on the basis of the relative intensity of the transition at various scattering angles. The ratio of the intensity of this transition to the allowed singlet–singlet transition at 6.9 eV was in a constant proportion to the corresponding ratio for the first triplet state (3.9 eV) at all scattering angles. The spacings of the first and second and second and third triplet states in benzene were determined to be 0.80 and 0.85 eV.

	abstract = {The account given here of the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of antiferromagnetic (AFM) chromium alloys supplements the previous review of spin-density-wave (SDW) antiferromagnetism in pure Cr. The existence of an incommensurate spin-density wave results from Fermi-surface nesting, which changes with electron concentration as atoms of different valence are introduced into Cr. This gives rise for most impurities to a prototypical composition-temperature (x-T) magnetic phase diagram, which is described quite well by a model of nesting electron-hole octahedra and electron reservoir, with changes in the amplitude of the spin-density wave and its wave vector corresponding to the changes with impurity concentration of the Néel temperature. There are, however, numerous cases of idiosyncratic behavior in the x-T phase diagram, some of which appear to correspond to unusual features in the pressure-temperature (p-T) phase diagram, e.g., in the CrFe, CrAl, and CrSi alloy systems. With these exceptions and a few others, the effect of impurities in the same group of the periodic table is fairly similar, so that this classification is used for the description of both the x-T and p-T phase diagrams. The properties of the alloy systems for each group of impurities are first summarized in the context of the x-T phase diagram. The general features of the various physical properties are then considered: (1) magnetic susceptibility, whose temperature dependence signals the existence of local moments in some cases; (2) transport properties, in particular, electrical resistivity and thermopower, which show characteristic temperature dependence corresponding to the occurrence of spin fluctuations around the Néel temperature TN, and in some cases well into the paramagnetic phase, followed below TN by effects due to the electron-hole condensation in the ordered AFM phase, and in some cases at lower temperatures to the formation of local impurity states; and (3) magnetoelastic properties, which show large effects associated with the spin-density wave and with SDW fluctuations in Cr alloys just as in pure Cr. Analysis of magnetic anomalies in the thermal expansion and bulk modulus in terms of magnetic Grüneisen parameters is employed for some Cr alloy systems to describe the large body of experimental data. The empirical correspondence between increasing volume and increasing electron concentration is illustrated for several systems. The study of dilute Cr alloys provides insight into the reason for pure Cr having a weak first-order Néel transition, and provides examples of other phase transitions, including the incommensurate-commensurate SDW, the spin-glass, and AFM-superconducting phase transitions. The similarities between the incommensurate SDW fluctuations in Cr and Cr alloys and in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates strongly motivates, in particular, the examination of the inelastic neutron-scattering results. Optical properties provide an interesting picture of the relation between the magnitude of the energy gap at the Fermi surface and the Néel temperature, which is quite different in the incommensurate and commensurate SDW alloys. Local probes providing microscopic information about the environment of an impurity are clearly of great potential value in Cr alloy systems. The Mössbauer effect has, however, yielded disappointingly little information, but other probes such as perturbed angular correlation and nuclear magnetic resonance have provided interesting results.},

	abstract = {We present extensive simulations on the TIP4P∕2005 water model showing significantly enhanced small-angle scattering (SAS) in the supercooled regime. The SAS is related to the presence of a Widom line (T(W)) characterized by maxima in thermodynamic response functions and Ornstein-Zernike correlation length. Recent experimental small-angle x-ray scattering data [Huang et al., J. Chem. Phys. 133, 134504 (2010)] are excellently reproduced, albeit with an increasing temperature offset at lower temperatures. Assuming the same origin of the SAS in experiment and model this suggests the existence of a Widom line also in real supercooled water. Simulations performed at 1000 bar show an increased abruptness of a crossover from dominating high-density (HDL) to dominating low-density (LDL) liquid and strongly enhanced SAS associated with crossing T(W), consistent with a recent determination of the critical pressure of TIP4P∕2005 at 1350 bar. Furthermore, good agreement with experimental isothermal compressibilities at 1000, 1500, and 2000 bar shows that the high pressure supercooled thermodynamic behavior of water is well described by TIP4P∕2005. Analysis of the tetrahedrality parameter Q reveals that the HDL-LDL structural transition is very sharp at 1000 bar, and that structural fluctuations become strongly coupled to density fluctuations upon approaching T(W). Furthermore, the tetrahedrality distribution becomes bimodal at ambient temperatures, an observation that possibly provides a link between HDL-LDL fluctuations and the structural bimodality in liquid water indicated by x-ray spectroscopic techniques. Computed x-ray absorption spectra are indeed found to show sensitivity to the tetrahedrality parameter.},

The generalized PY equation was decomposed into a set of coupled integral equations by expanding the correlation functions in series of spherical harmonics. Iterative solutions of the Fourier‐transformed form of these expressions were obtained after truncating the set. Correlation functions were calculated in this way as a function of density for two values of the molecular length and then used to evaluate compressibility factors from both the pressure and compressibility equations. It is found that the pair correlations at moderate densities obtained from the PY equation do not differ greatly from those calculated previously from density series. In addition, the various equations of state for this and similar hard‐core nonspherical models do not differ greatly from one another or from the hard‐sphere results, when the data are plotted as a function of reduced density using a reducing factor proportional to the molecular volume. A brief discussion is given of the limitations imposed upon these results by the mathematical approximations introduced.},

	abstract = {Ions with like-charges repel each other with a magnitude given by the Coulomb law. The repulsion is also known to persist in aqueous solutions albeit factored by the medium's dielectric constant. In this paper, we report results from molecular dynamics simulations of alkali halides salt solutions indicating an effective attraction between some of the like-charged monovalent ions. The attraction is observed between anions, as well as between cations, leading to the formation of dimers with lifetimes on the order of few picoseconds. Two mechanisms have been identified to drive this counterintuitive attraction. The first is exhibited by high-charge density ions, such as fluoride, at low salt concentrations, yielding effective attractions with magnitude up to the order of 1–2 kT. In this case, the stronger local electric field generated when the two ions are in contact augments the alignment of neighboring waters toward the ions. This results in a gain of substantial favorable ion-water interaction energy. For fluorides, this interaction constitutes the major change among the different energy components compensating for the anion-anion repulsion, and therefore, rendering like-charge association possible. The second mechanism involves mediation by counterions, the attractions increase with salt concentration and are characterized by small magnitudes. In particular, clusters of ion triplets, in which a counterion is either bridging the two like-charged ions or is paired to only one of them, are formed. Although these two mechanisms may not yield net attractions in many cases, they might still be operational and significant, explaining effective repulsions between like-charged ions with magnitudes much smaller than expected based on continuum electrostatics.},

	abstract = {The influence of the local environment on vacancy and self-interstitial formation energies has been investigated in a face-centered-cubic (fcc) Fe-10Ni-20Cr model alloy by analyzing an extensive set of first-principle calculations based on density functional theory. Chemical disorder has been considered by designing special quasirandom structures and four different collinear magnetic structures have been investigated in order to determine a relevant reference state to perform point defect calculations at 0 K. Two different convergence methods have also been used to characterize the importance of the method on the results. Although our fcc Fe-10Ni-20Cr would be better represented in terms of applications by the paramagnetic state, we found that the antiferromagnetic single-layer magnetic structure was the most stable at 0 K and we chose it as a reference state to determine the point defect properties. Point defects have been introduced in this reference state, i.e., vacancies and Fe-Fe, Fe-Ni, Fe-Cr, Cr-Cr, Ni-Ni, and Ni-Cr dumbbell interstitials oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the single layer antiferromagnetic planes. Each point defect studied was introduced at different lattice sites to consider a sufficient variety of local environments and analyze its influence on the formation energy values. We have estimated the point defect formation energies with linear regressions using variables which describe the local environment surrounding the point defects. The number and the position of Ni and Cr first nearest neighbors to the point defects were found to drive the evolution of the formation energies. In particular, Ni is found to decrease and Cr to increase the vacancy formation energy of the model alloy, while the opposite trends are found for the dumbbell interstitials. This study suggested that, to a first approximation, the first nearest atoms to point defects can provide reliable estimates of point defect formation energies.},

	abstract = {Extended depolarized light scattering (EDLS) measurements have been recently employed to investigate the dynamics of water solvating biological molecules, giving evidence of the presence of two different dynamical regimes among water molecules. An interpretation of EDLS has been proposed that provides an independent estimate of the retardation factor of slowdown with respect to fast water molecules and of the number of solvent molecules affected by this slowing down. Nevertheless this measure is an inherently complex one, due to the collective nature of the physical property probed. In the present work a molecular dynamics (MD) approach has been used to more deeply understand experimental results. Time correlation functions of the collective polarizability anisotropy have been calculated for the prototype disaccharide trehalose in aqueous solutions as a function of concentration. The unique capability of MD to disentangle the contributions to the dynamics arising from solute, solvent, and cross terms between the two allowed us to check the reliability of an interpretation that assumes a spectral separation of water and sugar dynamics, as well as to highlight the very presence of two distinct relaxation processes in water. The two processes have been attributed to the dynamics of bulk and hydration water, respectively. A retardation factor of {\textasciitilde}5 and concentration dependent hydration numbers have been observed, in good agreement with experimental results [Paolantoni, M.; et al. J. Phys. Chem.

This difference in lifetime allows for a clear separation of the response of the solvation shell from that of the bulk liquid. We observe that the solvating HDO molecules show much slower hydrogen-bond and reorientation dynamics than bulk water molecules. In contrast, the dynamics of the water molecules outside the first ionic hydration shell are observed to be negligibly affected by the ions.},

	abstract = {Temperature-dependent properties of hydrophobic interactions are investigated by simulating the potential of mean force (PMF) between two methane-like solutes in TIP4P model water. Independent results from test particle insertion and free energy perturbation are compared to ensure that zero-PMF baselines are accurate. PMFs are computed under atmospheric pressure at five temperatures from 5 to 95 °C using constant-pressure simulations. The temperature dependence we observe does not agree with previous results from constant-volume simulations, highlighting the important effects of temperature-dependent water density on PMFs. Heat capacity changes upon association of two solutes are estimated at the PMF contact minimum, desolvation barrier, and the solvent (water)-separated minimum. The magnitude of the heat capacity change upon contact formation is much smaller than that predicted by the solvent accessible surface area (SASA). More surprisingly, the heat capacity change upon bringing two methanes from infinity to the desolvation barrier is large and positive. This implies that the thermodynamic signatures of the free energy barrier to desolvation have signs opposite to desolvation itself. This feature is not predicted by either SASA or a volume-based solvent exclusion model. The implications of these and other observations on implicit-solvent model potentials are discussed. Formulations based on thermodynamic perturbation and Widom’s potential distribution theory are developed to relate PMF and hydration mean forces to the underlying structural properties of aqueous solutions. In particular, we provide a theoretical perspective to understand PMF in terms of local water density and the occurrences of configurations with highly unfavorable solute–solvent repulsive interactions.},

	abstract = {We assess the accuracy and efficiency of two particle-based mesoscopic simulation methods, namely, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD) for predicting a complex flow in a microfluidic geometry. Since both DPD and SRD use soft or weakly interacting particles to carry momentum, both methods contain unavoidable inertial effects and unphysically high fluid compressibility. To assess these effects, we compare the predictions of DPD and SRD for both an exact Stokes-flow solution and nearly exact solutions at finite Reynolds numbers from the finite element method for flow in a straight channel with periodic slip boundary conditions. This flow represents a periodic electro-osmotic flow, which is a complex flow with an analytical solution for zero Reynolds number. We find that SRD is roughly ten-fold faster than DPD in predicting the flow field, with better accuracy at low Reynolds numbers. However, SRD has more severe problems with compressibility effects than does DPD, which limits the Reynolds numbers attainable in SRD to around 25–50, while DPD can achieve Re higher than this before compressibility effects become too large. However, since the SRD method runs much faster than DPD does, we can afford to enlarge the number of grid cells in SRD to reduce the fluid compressibility at high Reynolds number. Our simulations provide a method to estimate the range of conditions for which SRD or DPD is preferable for mesoscopic simulations.},

Such mixtures, which are of current technological interest, are known to be thermodynamically nonideal, and there has been a good deal of work to understand the structural effects factors that contribute to the nonideality. New experimental methods allow observations at the La K-absorption edge at the high temperatures of interest, and the ability of the technique to obtain reliable information even at very low La3+ concentrations in multicomponent mixtures is demonstrated. Both the mean La3+?Cl? interionic separation and the mean La3+ coordination number are found to decrease as the concentration of La3+ in the mixture decreases. The rate of decrease depends on the identity of the alkali and alkaline earth cations present in the mixtures in a way that parallels the degree of nonideality of the different systems; it is greatest for those alkali cations that coordinate Cl? weakly. In dilute mixtures with such cations La3+ is able to adopt a very stable octahedral coordination geometry but this is inhibited by the presence of more strongly coordinating cations like Li+ and Mg2+.},

The values were fitted to a unique equation as a simultaneous function of temperature and acetonitrile composition. Densities of these mixtures at temperatures from (5 to 55) °C and different compositions have been collected from the literature. The complete data set was critically analyzed, the outliers were excluded, and the remaining values were also fitted to a unique equation as a function of temperature and acetonitrile composition. From the dielectric constants and densities, the activity coefficients of ions can be calculated by means of the Debye?Hückel approach, allowing the study of the ionic equilibria and determination of reference pH values or acidity constants in any acetonitrile/water mixture at any temperature within the studied range.},

It is shown how full Galilean invariance can be achieved for arbitrary Mach numbers and how other low temperature anomalies can be removed. The relaxation towards thermal equilibrium is investigated numerically, and the relaxation time is measured. Equations of motions for the correlation functions of coarse-grained hydrodynamic variables are derived using a discrete-time projection operator technique, and the Green-Kubo relations for all relevant transport coefficients are given. In the following paper (Part 2), analytic expressions for the transport coefficients are derived and compared with simulation results. Long-time tails in the velocity and stress autocorrelation functions are measured and shown to be in good agreement with previous mode-coupling theories for continuous systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.7008},
	abstract = {A classical density functional theory is applied to study solvation of solutes in water. An approx- imate form of the excess functional is proposed for water. This functional requires the knowledge of pure solvent direct correlation functions. Those functions can be computed by using molecular simulations such as molecular dynamic or Monte Carlo. It is also possible to use functions that have been determined experimentally. The functional minimization gives access to the solvation free energy and to the equilibrium solvent density. Some correction to the functional are also proposed to get the proper tetrahedral order of solvent molecules around a charged solute and to reproduce the correct long range hydrophobic behavior of big apolar solutes. To proceed the numerical minimization of the functional, the theory has been discretized on two tridimensional grids, one for the space coordinates, the other for the angular coordinates, in a functional minimization code written in modern Fortran, mdft. This program is used to study the solvation in water of small solutes of several kind, atomic and molecular, charged or neutral. More complex solutes, a neutral clay and a small protein have also been studied by functional minimization. In each case the classical density functional theory is able to reproduce the exact results predicted by MD. The computational cost is at least three order of magnitude less than in explicit methods.},

The theory, which is an extension of the reference interaction site model (RISM) in three dimensions, yields the average density from the solvent interactions sites at all points r around a molecular solute of arbitrary shape. Both solute?solvent electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are fully included, and solvent packing is taken into account. The approach is illustrated by calculating the average oxygen and hydrogen density of liquid water around two molecular solutes:? water and N-methylacetamide. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to test the results obtained from the integral equation. It is observed that important microscopic structural features of the average water density due to hydrogen bonding are reproduced by the integral equation. The integral equation has a simple formal structure and is easy to implement numerically. It offers a powerful alternative to computer simulations with explicit solvent molecules and to continuum solvent representations for incorporating solvation effects in a wide range of applications.},

We found that in general Tin+1Cn and Tin+1Al0.5Cn NBs retain the atomic geometries of the corresponding blocks of the MAX phases, but some structural distortions for the NBs occur owing to the lowering of the coordination number for atoms in the external Ti sheets of the nano-block structures. Our analysis based on their cohesive and formation energies reveals that the stability of the nano-block structures increases with index n (or, in other words, with a growth of the number of Ti–C bonds), the Al-containing NBs becoming more stable than the “pure” Ti–C NBs. Our data show that the magnetization of the simulated planar nano-block structures can be expected; so, for the Ti3C2 nano-block the most stable will be the spin configuration, where within each external Ti sheet the spins are coupled ferromagnetically together with antiferromagnetic ordering between opposite external titanium sheets of this nano-block.},

The density-functional which yields the HNC closure for a hard-sphere fluid near a hard wall is modified so that the modified functional yields the Carnahan-Starling bulk pressure and hence fulfils the necessary conditions. The density profile to which this gives rise is compared with the results of computer simulation for various bulk densities when the fluid is bounded by two hard walls separated by a distance equal to 8 diameters of the hard sphere.

	abstract = {Low accuracy of the Solvation Free Energy (SFE) calculation is a known problem of the numerical methods of the Integral Equation Theory of Liquids and the Classical Density Functional Theory (Classical DFT). Although functionals with empirical corrections can essentially improve the predictability of the methods, their universality is still a question. In our recent paper we connected the SFE calculation errors with the incorrect pressure in the Classical DFT and proposed the a posteriory correction to improve the results (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 5, 1925-1942 ). This paper raised a discussion in the community. In particular, recently appeared a critical reply where pointed some thermodynamical inconsistencies of the derivations in our paper (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 11, 378-380). In the present work we re-derive the pressure correction in a more simple way and show that despite the inaccuracies during the derivation, the final form of the previously derived correction is correct. We also test the applicability of the proposed correction to the functionals which include a three- and many- body terms from the fundamental measure theory (FMT) for hard sphere fluid. We test all the functionals on a set of model systems and discuss the obtained results.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of particles from the center of a sphere of radius R is considered theoretically. An expression is obtained for the probability that a particle will be collected at a small probe within the sphere rather than at the surface. This result forms the basis for an experiment to determine the momentum transfer cross section Qm for electrons in a gas. The only parameter which must be known in order to obtain absolute cross sections by the technique proposed is the acceptance coefficient for electrons at the probe. The probability Ac that a particle will have exactly c collisions characterized by a constant cross section Q before striking the surface of the sphere for the first time is evaluated. It is assumed that these collisions are not correlated with the diffusion process. In contrast with previous work the present method takes into account the variation of total diffusion time as well as the probability of a particular number of collisions during a given time. The probabilities A0, A1, and A2 are given in terms of elementary functions and a recursion relationship is given for the other A's. The expression A0=ycschy (where y=RN(3QQm)1/2 and N is the gas density) is useful in an experiment to determine the cross section for inelastic collisions between electrons and gases. The probability of more than any given number of collisions, the average number of collisions, and the mean-square deviation from this average are also evaluated.},

The translocation time τ is dependent on polymer-obstacle interaction and obstacle concentration. The influence of obstacles on the polymer translocation is explained qualitatively by the free energy landscape. There exists a special polymer-obstacle interaction at which the translocation time is roughly independent of the obstacle concentration at low obstacle concentration, and the strength of the special interaction is roughly independent of chain length N. Scaling relation τ ∼ N1.25 is observed for strong driving translocations. The diffusion property of polymer chain is also influenced by obstacles. Normal diffusion is only observed in dilute solution without obstacles or in a crowded environment with weak polymer-obstacle attraction. Otherwise, subdiffusion behavior of polymer is observed.},

For the case of a dipolar solvent, we show how this fundamental quantity can be extracted directly from molecular dynamics simulations of the pure solvent instead of the traditional route of integral equation theories. The direct correlation function computed from simulation is compared to approximate ones obtained from linearized and quadratic HNC integral closures. The performance of the corresponding density functionals is assessed, in comparison to "exact" molecular dynamics results, for the solvation free-energies and the solvent density profiles around simple molecular solutes.},

With nanometric pores the energy storage capacity is controlled by interfacial phenomena. With subnanometric pores, we demonstrate that a breakdown occurs with the emergence of molecular exclusion as a leading contribution. This bulk exclusion effect leads to an osmotic contribution to the pressure that can reach levels never previously sustained. We illustrate, on various electrolytes and different microporous materials, that a simple osmotic pressure law accounts quantitatively for the enhancement of the intrusion and extrusion pressures governing the forced wetting and spontaneous drying of the nanopores. Using electrolyte solutions, energy storage and power capacities can be widely enhanced.},

Herein we evaluate surface chemistries for heavy metal capture from biological fluids, various facets of the materials? biocompatibility, and the suitability of these materials as potential therapeutics. Of the materials tested, thiol-functionalized SAMMS proved most capable of removing selected heavy metals from biological solutions (i.e., blood, urine, etc.) Consequentially, thiol-functionalized SAMMS was further analyzed to assess the material?s performance under a number of different biologically relevant conditions (i.e., variable pH and ionic strength) to gauge any potentially negative effects resulting from interaction with the sorbent, such as cellular toxicity or the removal of essential minerals. Additionally, cellular uptake studies demonstrated no cell membrane permeation by the silica-based materials generally highlighting their ability to remain cellularly inert and thus nontoxic. The results show that organic ligand functionalized nanoporous silica could be a valuable material for a range of detoxification therapies and potentially other biomedical applications.},

Electrochemical devices with high energy and power densities can currently be powered only by batteries with organic liquid electrolytes. However, such batteries require relatively stringent safety precautions, making large-scale systems very complicated and expensive. The application of solid electrolytes is currently limited because they attain practically useful conductivities (10(-2) S cm(-1)) only at 50-80 °C, which is one order of magnitude lower than those of organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li(10)GeP(2)S(12) that has a new three-dimensional framework structure. It exhibits an extremely high lithium ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. This represents the highest conductivity achieved in a solid electrolyte, exceeding even those of liquid organic electrolytes. This new solid-state battery electrolyte has many advantages in terms of device fabrication (facile shaping, patterning and integration), stability (non-volatile), safety (non-explosive) and excellent electrochemical properties (high conductivity and wide potential window).},

These wave functions have been analyzed, via the use of localized and natural orbitals, to identify the electronic structure contributions to the chemistry of these systems. It is found that the electronic structures of all complexes can be rationalized through the use of a common orbital energy diagram. Single point multireference Moller?Plesset (MRMP2) perturbation theory calculations have been performed for the oxoMn(salen) system and these results verify that the CASSCF method gives accurate energy separations for the electronic states. We find that the CASSCF method predicts bound species for all compounds except for the triplet and quintet states of the oxoMn(salen) complex, which spontaneously dissociate in the gas phase. Calculations on the separated species [5A Mn(salen) + 3P O] indicate that the bound singlet species lies some 30 kcal/mol above the dissociated products at the CASSCF level. Attempts to obtain MRMP2 energies for the supersystem of the separated species failed; hence a more accurate value of the dissociation energy could not be determined. We also find, from CASSCF calculations, that the oxoMn(salen) complex is predicted to be a very potent electrophile.},

	abstract = {Isotope distributions in natural systems can be highly sensitive to the mass (m) dependence of solute diffusion coefficients (D) in liquid water. Isotope geochemistry studies routinely have assumed that this mass dependence either is negligible (as predicted by hydrodynamic theories) or follows a kinetic-theory-like inverse square-root relationship (D ∝ m−0.5). However, our recent experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the mass dependence of D is intermediate between hydrodynamic and kinetic theory predictions (D ∝ m−β with 0 ⩽ β \&lt; 0.2 for Li+, Cl−, Mg2+, and the noble gases). In this paper, we present new MD simulations and experimental results for Na+, K+, Cs+, and Ca2+ that confirm the generality of the inverse power-law relation D ∝ m−β. Our new findings allow us to develop a general description of the influence of solute valence and radius on the mass dependence of D for monatomic solutes in liquid water. This mass dependence decreases with solute radius and with the magnitude of solute valence. Molecular-scale analysis of our MD simulation results reveals that these trends derive from the exponent β being smallest for those solutes whose motions are most strongly coupled to solvent hydrodynamic modes.},

All the parameters involved in these models are extracted from first-principles density functional theory calculations. This step is routinely done through an extended force-matching procedure, which has proven to be very successful for molten oxides and molten fluorides. Recent developments based on the use of localized orbitals can be used to complement the force-matching procedure by allowing for the direct calculations of several parameters such as the individual polarizabilities.},

Consequently, despite dramatic advances in computational methodologies and resources, CG models enjoy surging popularity and are becoming increasingly equal partners to atomically detailed models. This perspective surveys the rapidly developing landscape of CG models for biomolecular systems. In particular, this review seeks to provide a balanced, coherent, and unified presentation of several distinct approaches for developing CG models, including top-down, network-based, native-centric, knowledge-based, and bottom-up modeling strategies. The review summarizes their basic philosophies, theoretical foundations, typical applications, and recent developments. Additionally, the review identifies fundamental inter-relationships among the diverse approaches and discusses outstanding challenges in the field. When carefully applied and assessed, current CG models provide highly efficient means for investigating the biological consequences of basic physicochemical principles. Moreover, rigorous bottom-up approaches hold great promise for further improving the accuracy and scope of CG models for biomolecular systems.},

An expression is obtained for the rate constant in terms of the dielectric response function of the solvent. It is shown thereby that this expression, which is usually derived using a molecular harmonic oscillator (“spin-boson”) model, is valid not only for approximately harmonic systems such as solids but also for strongly molecularly anharmonic systems such as polar solvents. The derivation is a relatively simple alternative to one based on quantum field theoretic techniques. The effect of system inhomogeneity due to the presence of the solute molecule is also now included. An expression is given generalizing to frequency space and quantum mechanically the analogue of an electrostatic result relating the reorganization free energy to the free energy difference of two hypothetical systems [J. Chem. Phys. 39, 1734 (1963)]. The latter expression has been useful in adapting specific electrostatic models in the literature to electron transfer problems, and the present extension can be expected to have a similar utility. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

The results suggest that the normalized velocity distribution is sensitive to the spatial resolution but not the details of the packing. With increasing spatial resolution, simulation results converge to a velocity distribution with a sharp peak near zero. A simple argument is presented to explain this result. Changes in the shape of the distribution as a function of flow rate are determined for low Reynolds numbers, and the large-velocity tail of the distribution is shown to depend on the packing geometry. The effect of a finite Reynolds number on the apparent permeability is demonstrated and discussed in relation to previous results in the literature.

We will in particular explore the interplay between bulk and interface phenomena. The limit of validity of the continuum approaches will be discussed, as well as the numerous surface induced effects occurring at these scales, from hydrodynamic slippage to the various electro-kinetic phenomena originating from the couplings between hydrodynamics and electrostatics.

From numerical simulations, we find that both fractional Gaussian noise and Lévy-stable noise in asymmetric corrugated channels can break thermodynamical equilibrium and induce directed transport. The rectified mechanisms for fractional Brownian motion and Lévy flights are different. The former is caused by non-uniform spectral distribution (low or high frequencies) of fractional Gaussian noise, while the latter is due to the nonthermal character (occasional long jumps) of the Lévy-stable noise. For fractional Brownian motion, average velocity increases with the Hurst exponent for the persistent case, while for the antipersistent case there exists an optimal value of Hurst exponent at which average velocity takes its maximal value. For Lévy flights, the group velocity decreases monotonically as the Lévy index increases. In addition, for both cases, the optimized periodicity and radius at the bottleneck can facilitate the directed transport. Our results could be implemented in constrained structures with narrow channels and pores where the particles undergo anomalous diffusion.},

For a mixture of TPP with toluene or aniline, we find that both liquid I and II mix well and liquid II remains in a 'liquid' state, in contrast to pure TPP, where liquid II is a non-ergodic amorphous state. This is the first example of a 'true' LLT in a molecular liquid. Furthermore, we find demixing induced by the LLT for a mixture of TPP with diethyl ether or ethanol. These findings will open a new phase of research towards various applications of the LLT.},

	abstract = {A complete wave-vector analysis has been made of the gradient coefficient for the exchange-correlation energy of a nonuniform electronic system. It is shown that the majority of the contribution comes from a very small but universal region of k⃗ space near the origin. From this it can be concluded that random-phase-approximation-like calculations, like the present one or that of Rasolt and Geldart, which treat this region correctly, are likely to provide accurate results for the gradient coefficient and hence for the energy and structure of a system whose density is truly slowly varying. However, it also shows that the criterion for the validity of the gradient approximation itself is much more severe than previously supposed, so that the usual type of application, to say a surface or bulk material, is incorrect. For the surface case this is verified in unequivocal detail. On the other hand, a generalization of the gradient scheme based on an average slope instead of a local slope is proposed. This gives good agreement with limiting cases where they exist, and rough agreement with the interpolation scheme proposed previously by the authors.},

	abstract = {A theoretical study of the dielectric friction on an ion moving through a dipolar liquid is presented. A microscopic expression for the dielectric friction is derived from linear response theory for a Brownian ion. This expression supports the picture of a ‘‘dynamic solventberg’’ model in the sense that much of the contribution to dielectric friction (ζDF) comes from the nearest‐neighbor molecules. The translational modes of the solvent are found to have a very strong influence on the dielectric friction, in agreement with the observation of Colonomos and Wolynes [J. Chem. Phys. 71, 2644 (1979)]. In fact, except in the limit of small ion size, the microscopic ζDF is significantly larger than the continuum ζDF in the absence of the translational motion of the solvent molecules, but the reverse is obtained in the presence of a substantial translational contribution. It is found that the recovery of the continuum limit results from the molecular expression requires serious assumptions, some of which are hard to justify. It is also found that the point dipole approximation for the dipolar solvent molecule leads to improper results for ζDF because this approximation gives a wrong wave vector (k) dependence of the wave vector dependent dielectric function (ϵ(k)) of the liquid at large k (kσ≫2π, where σ is the solvent molecular diameter). We show that within a linear equilibrium theory for dipolar liquids, the cross correlations between the short ranged hard force and the long ranged dipolar force is zero so the calculations of Colonomos and Wolynes are internally consistent. However, this cross correlation can be quite important if the soft force also contains a spherically symmetric part. The similarity between the solvent role in ζDF and in the time‐dependent fluorescence Stokes shift is discussed. The limitations of the present theory are also pointed out.},

First, simulations of the liquid?vapor interface demonstrate that the model is able to predict the surface tension of the fluid (for which we obtain a value of 39.4 mN·m?1 at 400 K). Second, simulations were performed at constant potential differences applied between two graphite electrodes. From simulations with different applied potentials, the differential capacitances of the positive and negative electrodes can be calculated. It appears that both capacitances (C+ = 3.9 ?F·cm?2 for the positive electrode and C? = 4.8 ?F·cm?2 for the negative electrode) agree very well with simulations results obtained with an all-atom model. The coarse-grained model also accurately reproduces the two-dimensional structure observed at the graphite?ionic liquid interface, namely, a defective hexagonal lattice with a lattice spacing of approximately 10 Å.},

The multilayer relaxation sequences correlate with the reduced coordination in surface layers and can be explained in terms of a simple electrostatic picture. The surface energies scale almost linearly with the surface roughness. They agree well with the experimental surface tensions and show a small anisotropy in agreement with predictions based on measurements for other metals. The equilibrium shape of a bcc Fe crystal is determined and discussed. The work function anisotropy is calculated and rationalized in terms of changes in the valence charge distribution. Significantly increased local magnetic moments of atoms in the surface region are determined. The correlation between the anisotropy of the surface magnetic moments and atomic coordination in the outermost layers is demonstrated to follow a simple rule.},

	abstract = {The interior of a living cell is a crowded, heterogenuous, fluctuating environment. Hence, a major challenge in modeling intracellular transport is to analyze stochastic processes within complex environments. Broadly speaking, there are two basic mechanisms for intracellular transport: passive diffusion and motor-driven active transport. Diffusive transport can be formulated in terms of the motion of an overdamped Brownian particle. On the other hand, active transport requires chemical energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, and can be direction specific, allowing biomolecules to be transported long distances; this is particularly important in neurons due to their complex geometry. In this review a wide range of analytical methods and models of intracellular transport is presented. In the case of diffusive transport, narrow escape problems, diffusion to a small target, confined and single-file diffusion, homogenization theory, and fractional diffusion are considered. In the case of active transport, Brownian ratchets, random walk models, exclusion processes, random intermittent search processes, quasi-steady-state reduction methods, and mean-field approximations are considered. Applications include receptor trafficking, axonal transport, membrane diffusion, nuclear transport, protein-DNA interactions, virus trafficking, and the self-organization of subcellular structures.},

Here we use new opportunities offered by nanofluidic systems to create an osmotic diode exhibiting asymmetric water flow under reversal of osmotic driving. We show that a surface charge asymmetry built on a nanochannel surface leads to nonlinear couplings between water flow and the ion dynamics, which are capable of water flow rectification. This phenomenon opens new opportunities for water purification and complex flow control in nanochannels.},

	abstract = {We investigate the hydration dynamics of a small globular protein, hen egg-white lysozyme. Extensive simulations (two trajectories of 9 ns each) were carried out to identify the time-scales and mechanism of water attachment to this protein. The location of the surface and integral water molecules in lysozyme was also investigated. Three peculiar temporal scales of the hydration dynamics can be discerned: two among these, with sub-nanosecond mean residence time, tau(w), are characteristic of surface hydration water; the slower time-scale (tau(w) approximately 2/3 ns) is associated with buried water molecules in hydrophilic pores and in superficial clefts. The computed tau(w) values in the two independent runs fall in a similar range and are consistent with each other, thus adding extra weight to our result. The tau(w) of surface water obtained from the two independent trajectories is 20 and 24 ps. In both simulations only three water molecules are bound to lysozyme for the entire length of the trajectories, in agreement with nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion estimates. Locations other than those identified in the protein crystal are found to be possible for these long-residing water molecules. The dynamics of the hydration water molecules observed in our simulations implies that each water molecule visits a multitude of residues during the lifetime of its bound with the protein. The number of residues seen by a single water molecule increases with the time-scale of its residence time and, on average, is equal to one only for the water molecules with shorter residence time. Thus, tau(w) values obtained from inelastic neutron scattering and based on jump-diffusion models are likely not to account for the contribution of water molecules with longer residence time.},

	abstract = {We develop an efficient Ewald method of molecular dynamics simulation for calculating the electrostatic interactions among charged and polar particles between parallel metallic plates, where we may apply an electric field with an arbitrary size. We use the fact that the potential from the surface charges is equivalent to the sum of those from image charges and dipoles located outside the cell. We present simulation results on boundary effects of charged and polar fluids, formation of ionic crystals, and formation of dipole chains, where the applied field and the image interaction are crucial. For polar fluids, we find a large deviation of the classical Lorentz-field relation between the local field and the applied field due to pair correlations along the applied field. As general aspects, we clarify the difference between the potential-fixed and the charge-fixed boundary conditions and examine the relationship between the discrete particle description and the continuum electrostatics.},

Using the weighted density approach, we require the density functional to match with several observed properties of the fluid such as equation of state and surface tension. We also show that weighting functions for calculating the weighted density can be obtained from experimental data. Using these elements, we construct a spatial density functional theory of water and apply it to obtain densities and solvation energies of a hard-sphere solute with encouraging results.},

Experimental results indicate the presence of a slow relaxation mode related to the solute dynamics, which is clearly separated from the solvent one. The spectral analysis reveals the existence of two separate solvent relaxation processes assigned to hydrating and bulk water molecules. The picosecond dynamics of water molecules directly interacting with the solute (proximal water) is consistently delayed with the corresponding relaxation time increase is about 5-6 times compared to the bulk. The slowing down induced by the sugar on the water dynamics mainly involves a restricted hydration layer constituted of 16-18 water molecules. These results improve our knowledge about the influence of carbohydrates on the fast rearrangement dynamics of water and may serve as a model to gain important insight on basic solvation properties of other biorelevant systems in aqueous media.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in computer speed and capacity have opened the access to highly accurate molecular dynamics simulations based on quantum mechanically calculated forces for the chemically relevant region around ions in solution (QM/MM formalism). This accuracy, although still extremely consuming (30–300 days of CP time per simulation), is needed for reliable structural details and ligand exchange rates. A large number of main group and transition metal ions have been investigated by this approach, giving very detailed insight into the properties of these ions in solution and allowing to classify the ions by various characteristics. Most first-row transition metal ions have a very stable first hexa-coordinated solvation shell, whose vibrational distortions, however, strongly influence the dynamics of the second shell. The dynamical Jahn–Teller effect – shown to be a femto- and picosecond phenomenon – can strongly influence ligand coordination and exchange dynamics. A large number of ions with very labile solvation shell such as most main group ions, but also transition metal ions, e.g. Ag(I) and Hg(II), can change their coordination within the picosecond scale, leading to an almost simultaneous presence of several species hardly accessible by present experimental techniques. Among these ions, the structure breakers are of particular interest, and it could be shown that there are two types of them, one with a large and very labile first coordination shell such as Cs(I), the other characterised by a small first but an unusually large second solvation shell such as Au(I). Investigations of metal ions coordinated to ammonia ligands have shown that coordination to hetero-atoms can accelerate the ligand exchange reaction rates by several orders of magnitude, e.g. for Cu(II) and Ni(II). Simulations of ions in aqueous ammonia gave a very detailed picture of the complexity of species almost simultaneously present and illustrate the enormous difficulties encountered when trying to fit X-ray or neutron diffraction data for such systems. In general, ligand exchange rates situated in the picosecond range are far below the NMR scale, and as femtosecond laser pulse spectroscopy could not be applied so far to ionic solutions, accurate simulations have become a very important tool to access structure and dynamics of solvated ions. A number of VIDEO clips supplied on the Web as supporting material illustrates the processes occurring in solutions of the metal ions.},

	abstract = {Crystalloluminescence, the long-lived emission of visible light during the crystallization of certain salts, was first observed over 200 years ago; however, the origin of this luminescence is still not well understood. The observations suggest that the process of crystallization may not be purely classical but also involves an essential electronic structure component. Strong electric field fluctuations may play an important role in this process by providing the necessary driving force for the observed electronic structure changes. The main objective of this work is to provide a basic understanding of the fluctuations in charge, electric potentials, and electric fields for concentrated aqueous NaCl electrolytes. Our charge analysis reveals that the water molecules in the first solvation shell of the ions serve as a sink for electron density originating on Cl?. We find that the electric fields inside aqueous electrolytes are extremely large (up to several V/Å) and thus may alter the ground and excited electronic states in the condensed phase. Furthermore, our results show that the potential and field distributions are largely independent of concentration. We also find the field component distributions to be Gaussian for the ions and non-Gaussian for the O and H sites (computed in the lab frame of reference), however, these non-Gaussian distributions are readily modeled via an orientationally averaged nonzero mean Gaussian plus a zero mean Gaussian. These calculations and analyses provide the first steps toward understanding the magnitude and fluctuations of charge, electric potentials, and fields in aqueous electrolytes and what role these fields may play in driving charge redistribution/transfer during crystalloluminescence.},

In addition, our simulations compare various collision rules designed to remove spurious slip near solid surfaces, and the effects of these rules on the thermal motion of colloidal particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stochastic reflection of the fluid at solid boundaries fails to faithfully represent stick boundary conditions, and conclude that bounce-back conditions should be applied at both mobile and stationary surfaces. Finally, we generalize these ideas to create partial slip boundary conditions at both stationary and mobile surfaces.},

Microchannels, however, are characterized by a large surface-to-volume ratio, so that surface properties strongly affect flow resistance in submicrometre devices.

The Cr local structure resolved by extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is also found to be affected by the alloy’s composition. Both EXAFS and ab initio calculations show a change in the Cr local atomic structure above 10 at.\% Cr content from the distance contraction of the first two coordination shells around the Cr absorbing atom.

	abstract = {The experimental NMR relaxation study of Xe-131 dissolved in 1,3-dioxane and 1,4-dioxane indicates that the intermolecular quadrupole relaxation mechanism is equally as efficient in both solvents even if 1,3-dioxane is a dipolar molecule while 1,4-dioxane is not. In order to interpret this observation, molecular-dynamics simulations were performed for model systems of xenon gas dissolved in 1,3-dioxane and 1,4-dioxane. The simulations were able to satisfactorily reproduce various experimental data for each system and, in perfect agreement with the experiment, yielded the same 131Xe quadrupole relaxation rate in both solvents. This result was obtained assuming an electrostatic origin of the electric-field gradient, and therefore validates this explanation. In 1,4-dioxane, the overwhelming part of the fluctuating electric-field gradient experienced by the xenon nucleus is due to the quadrupole moment of the solvent molecules. In 1,3-dioxane, the dipole moment is responsible for approximately half the value of the amplitude of the electric-field-gradient fluctuations only. Contributions at least up to the octopole moment are important and, consequently, the correlation time characterizing the electric-field-gradient fluctuations in 1,3-dioxane is significantly shorter than the dipolar correlation time and is found to be similar to the correlation time value in 1,4-dioxane. The relaxation rate of 131Xe in dioxanes is compared to the value in other solvents including cyclohexane, and comments are made on the general concept of polarity.},

The variation of clay ordering as a function of clay concentration clearly indicated two concentration regimes, corresponding to free and collective orientations of the clay platelets, respectively.

After introducing some fundamental quantum mechanical concepts, the foundations of DFT and their realization in the framework of the Kohn–Sham construction are described. Following a brief exposition of the computational machinery required to carry out large-scale DFT calculations, the application of analytic derivative theory to DFT is developed in some detail. The cases covered include geometric, electric, magnetic and time-dependent perturbations. The developed theoretical apparatus is then applied to the calculations of molecular structures, vibrational energies as well as a wide variety of properties including absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, X-ray absorption, Mössbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Finally, the important subjects of spin state energetics and exchange couplings in oligomeric transition metal clusters is discussed.},

Measurements are reported for energy-band dispersions along the [010] direction parallel to the crystal surface. The periodicity of these band dispersions indicates that the valence electrons experience and self-consistently establish antiferromagnetism in the near-surface layers of Cr(001). We also present highly-surface-sensitive ARPES measurements of the energy-band dispersions along the [001] direction normal to the surface. The results suggest that the surface magnetic moments, which couple ferromagnetically to each other within the surface layer, couple antiferromagnetically to the moments of the atoms in the second layer. Temperature-dependent studies are presented that reveal the persistence of near-surface antiferromagnetic order for temperatures up to 2.5 times the bulk Néel temperature. The temperature dependence of this antiferromagnetic order suggests that its thermal stability derives in part from the stability of the Cr(001) ferromagnetic surface phase.},

	doi = {10.1021/jp205098a},
	abstract = {Systems of particles with interactions given by the Jagla core-softened pair potential are known to exhibit water-like thermodynamic anomalies and a liquid-liquid phase transition. The drawback of the Jagla potential is that it is characterized by discontinuous forces acting between particles and thus is not suitable for standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we introduce a smooth version of the Jagla potential based on two Fermi distributions and study the properties of a system of particles interacting via this new "Fermi-Jagla" pair potential by using standard MD simulations. We find that the liquid based on the Fermi-Jagla potential retains most of the properties of the liquid based on the original Jagla potential. Namely, it exhibits the following water-like anomalies: (i) decrease of density, (ii) increase of compressibility, κ(T)(T,P), and (iii) increase of isobaric specific heat, C(P)(T,P), upon isobaric cooling, and (iv) increase of diffusivity upon isothermal compression. The Fermi-Jagla potential also exhibits (i') density minima, (ii') compressibility minima, (iii') isobaric specific heat minima upon isobaric cooling, and (iv') diffusivity minima upon isothermal compression. As in the Jagla model case, we find a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) and a liquid-liquid critical point in the equilibrium liquid. Contrary to the case of the original Jagla model liquid, the LLPT line for the Fermi-Jagla potential has a negative slope in the P-T plane that extends well above the crystallization temperature. This feature makes the Fermi-Jagla potential a better candidate to reproduce the behavior of tetrahedral liquids including water, for which the LLPT line observed in simulations has also negative slope. In the glass state, the Fermi-Jagla pair potential results in reversible polyamorphism between low- and high-density amorphous solids (LDA and HDA, respectively). We also find that HDA results from pressure-induced amorphization of the model's low pressure crystal, as observed in water and other materials. The Fermi-Jagla pair potential, being a smooth function of the interparticle separation, can be easily implemented in standard MD simulation codes. Moreover, since spontaneous crystallization for the Fermi-Jagla potential can be avoided by fast cooling, it can be used to study the phenomenology of glasses.},

It is found that, although the structure is slightly saddled, the average methyl out-of-plane distance is only 0.63 Å, while it is much greater for the dodecasubstituted porphyrinate analogue (OMTPP)FeCl (1.19 Å) (Cheng, R.-J.; Chen, P.-Y.; Gau, P.-R.; Chen, C.-C.; Peng, S.-M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 2563?2569). In addition, the distance of iron from the mean plane of the four macrocycle nitrogens is also smaller for (OMTPCorr)FeCl (0.387 Å) than for (OMTPP)FeCl (0.46 Å). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of (OMTPCorr)FeCl, as well as the chloroiron complexes of triphenylcorrolate, (TPCorr)FeCl; 7,13-dimethyl-2,3,8,12,17,18-hexaethylcorrolate, (DMHECorr)FeCl; 7,8,12,13-tetramethyl-2,3,17,18-tetraethylcorrolate, (TMTECorr)FeCl; and the phenyliron complex of 7,13-dimethyl-2,3,8,12,17,18-hexaethylcorrolate, (DMHECorr)FePh, have been assigned, and the spin densities at the carbons that are part of the aromatic ring of the corrole macrocycle have been divided into the part due to spin delocalization by corrole ? Fe π donation and the part due to the unpaired electron present on the corrole ring. It is found that although the spin density at the ?-pyrrole positions is fairly similar to that of (TPCorr)FeCl, the meso-phenyl-carbon shift differences δm ? δp are opposite in sign of those of (TPCorr)FeCl. This finding suggests that the radical electron is ferromagnetically coupled to the unpaired electrons on iron, rather than antiferromagnetically coupled, as in all of the other chloroiron corrolates. The solution magnetic moment was measured for (OMTPCorr)FeCl and found to be ?eff = 4.7 ± 0.5 ?B, consistent with S = 2 and ferromagnetic coupling. From this study, two conclusions may be reached about iron corrolates:? (1) the spin states of chloroiron corrolates are extremely sensitive to the out-of-plane distance of iron, and (2) pyrrole-H or -C shifts are not useful in delineating the spin state and electron configuration of (anion)iron corrolates.},

This functional requires the knowledge of pure solvent direct correlation functions. Those functions can be computed by using molecular simulations such as molecular dynamic or Monte Carlo. It is also possible to use functions that have been determined experimentally. The functional minimization gives access to the solvation free energy and to the equilibrium solvent density. Some correction to the functional are also proposed to get the proper tetrahedral order of solvent molecules around a charged solute and to reproduce the correct long range hydrophobic behavior of big apolar solutes. To proceed the numerical minimization of the functional, the theory has been discretized on two tridimensional grids, one for the space coordinates, the other for the angular coordinates, in a functional minimization code written in modern Fortran, mdft. This program is used to study the solvation in water of small solutes of several kind, atomic and molecular, charged or neutral. More complex solutes, a neutral clay and a small protein have also been studied by functional minimization. In each case the classical density functional theory is able to reproduce the exact results predicted by MD. The computational cost is at least three order of magnitude less than in explicit methods.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic proteins are usually conserved in glassy matrixes composed of stabilizing excipients and a small amount of water, which both control their long-term stability, and thus their potential use in medical treatments. To shed some light on the protein-matrix interactions in such systems, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on matrixes of (i) the model globular protein lysozyme (L), (ii) the well-known bioprotectant trehalose (T), and (iii) the 1:1 (in weight) lysozyme/trehalose mixture (LT), at hydration levels h of 0.0, 0.075, and 0.15 (in g of water/g of protein or sugar). We also supplemented these simulations with complementary inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on the L, T, and LT lyophilized (freeze-dried) samples. The densities and free volume distributions indicate that trehalose improves the molecular packing of the LT glass with respect to the L one. Accordingly, the low-frequency vibrational densities of states (VDOS) and the mean square displacements (MSDs) of lysozyme reveal that it is less flexible-and thus less likely to unfold-in the presence of trehalose. Furthermore, at low contents (h = 0.075), water systematically stiffens the vibrational motions of lysozyme and trehalose, whereas it increases their MSDs on the nanosecond (ns) time scale. This stems from the hydrogen bonds (HBs) that lysozyme and trehalose form with water, which, interestingly, are stronger than the ones they form with each other but which, nonetheless, relax faster on the ns time scale, given the larger mobility of water. Moreover, lysozyme interacts preferentially with water in the hydrated LT mixtures, and trehalose appears to slow down significantly the relaxation of lysozyme-water HBs. Overall, our results suggest that the stabilizing efficiency of trehalose arises from its ability to (i) increase the number of HBs formed by proteins in the dry state and (ii) make the HBs formed by water with proteins stable on long ({\textgreater}ns) time scales.},

Here, we reliably estimate the vertical excitations of ethene and butadiene by performing FCIQMC calculations for spaces as large as 1018 and 1029 Slater determinants, respectively. For ethene, we obtain a vertical excitation energy in the range 7.89?7.96 eV, depending on the particular equilibrium ground-state geometry employed, and definitely higher than the absorption maximum located at 7.66 eV. For the computationally more challenging case of butadiene, our calculations provide a robust estimate of about 6.3 eV for this excitation, that is, 0.4 eV higher than the corresponding absorption band maximum. Our FCIQMC excitation energies represent a reliable benchmarking reference for future calculations.},

This conclusion is based on the observation that on freezing of salt water, ice expels the salt almost entirely as brine. Here, we show that this behaviour is not an intrinsic physico-chemical property of ice phases. We demonstrate by neutron diffraction that substantial amounts of dissolved LiCl can be built homogeneously into the ice VII structure if it is produced by recrystallization of its glassy (amorphous) state under pressure. Such 'alloyed' ice VII has significantly different structural properties compared with pure ice VII, such as an 8\% larger unit cell volume, 5 times larger displacement factors, an absence of a transition to an ordered ice VIII structure and plasticity. Our study suggests that there could be a whole new class of 'salty' high-pressure ice forms.},

We also analyze existing experimental data in light of the results obtained here. The halide ion simulations have been carried out using the interaction potentials of Koneshan et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B 1998, 102, 4193). We compute structural and dynamical properties of ions in water and explore their variation with size and charge of the ion. We find that ions of certain intermediate sizes exhibit a maximum in self-diffusivity in agreement with previous experimental measurements and computer simulations. We analyze molecular dynamics trajectories in light of the previous understanding of the levitation effect (LE) and the recent suggestion that ionic conductivity has its origin in LE (J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 8120). We report the distribution of void and neck radii that exist amidst water. Our analysis suggests that the ion with maximum self-diffusivity is characterized by a lower activation energy and a single-exponential decay of Fs(k,t). The behavior of these and other related quantities of the ion with maximum self-diffusivity are characteristic of the anomalous regime of the LE. The simulation results of Br- and Cl- ions in water also yield results in agreement with the predictions of LE. A plot of experimental conductivity data in the literature for alkali ions in water by Kay and Evans (J. Phys. Chem. 1966, 70, 2325) also yields a lower activation energy for the ion with maximum conductivity in excellent agreement with the LE. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing theories predict a lower activation energy for the ion with maximum conductivity.},

	abstract = {The present work presents three second-order perturbative developments from a complete active space (CAS) zero-order wave function, which are strictly additive with respect to molecular dissociation and intruder state free. They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall’s Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a CAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialities.},

Lett. 428 (2006) 461(20 September)] is reformulated and applied to multi-reference cases with complete active space (CAS) reference wave functions. The generalised van Vleck perturbation theory is employed to set up the perturbation equations. It is demonstrated that this leads to a consistent and well defined theory which fulfils all important criteria of a generally applicable ab initio method: The theory is proven numerically and analytically to be size-consistent and invariant with respect to unitary orbital transformations within the inactive, active and virtual orbital spaces. In contrast to most previously proposed multi-reference perturbation theories the necessary condition for a proper perturbation theory to fulfil the zeroth order perturbation equation is exactly satisfied with the RE partitioning itself without additional projectors on configurational spaces. The theory is applied to several excited states of the benchmark systems CH 2 , SiH 2 , and NH 2 , as well as to the lowest states of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms. In all cases comparisons are made with full configuration interaction results. The multi-reference (MR)-RE method is shown to provide very rapidly converging perturbation series. Energy differences between states of similar configurations converge even faster.},

Three athermal 3-D LBE models (Q15D3, Q19D3, and Q27D3) are studied and compared in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The boundary treatment recently developed by Filippova and Hänel (1998, J. Comp. Phys.147, 219) and Mei et al. (1999, J. Comp. Phys.155, 307) in 2-D is extended to and implemented for 3-D. The convergence, stability, and computational efficiency of the 3-D LBE models with the boundary treatment for curved boundaries were tested in simulations of four 3-D flows: (1) Fully developed flows in a square duct, (2) flow in a 3-D lid-driven cavity, (3) fully developed flows in a circular pipe, and (4) a uniform flow over a sphere. We found that while the 15-velocity 3-D (Q15D3) model is more prone to numerical instability and the Q27D3 is more computationally intensive, the Q19D3 model provides a balance between computational reliability and efficiency. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrated that the boundary treatment for 3-D arbitrary curved geometry has second-order accuracy and possesses satisfactory stability characteristics.},

Specifically, we solve (i) the site–site Ornstein–Zernike equation with the hypernetted‐chain closure, and (ii) the Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi equations with the hypernetted‐chain closure as well as with the zeroth‐order bridge functions, and compare their predictions of the structure, thermodynamics, and phase behavior of water with those obtained from computer simulations and experimental measurements. The predictions of the various site–site pair correlation functions of water for both integral equations are comparable. However, the Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi equations seem to better predict the structure of the fluid beyond the first coordination shell. In addition, the Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi equations provide better estimates of the thermodynamic properties of water as compared to those of the site–site Ornstein–Zernike equation, when the results are compared with those of computer simulations. We also predict the liquid–vapor coexistence curve and the vapor pressure of water using both integral equations. The Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi equations predict higher densities of the coexisting liquid and vapor branches as compared to those predicted by the site–site Ornstein–Zernike equation. The predictions of the Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi equations for the liquid branch are found to be in better agreement with the computer simulations data, while the site–site Ornstein–Zernike equation is found to work better for the vapor branch. The vapor pressure predictions of the site–site Ornstein–Zernike equation are found to be in good agreement with the experimental values, while the Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi equations are found to give slightly higher predictions of the vapor pressure.},

In the second part of the work, a stochastic model for the cage is developed on the basis of these informations. The model is characterized by a particular choice for the set of independent stochastic variables and for the evolution operators describing each elementary process. Accurate solutions are derived numerically, while analytical solutions are obtained by separating the cage frame rotations from fast variables like the solute velocity. The calculation of correlation functions allows the comparison with MD results. A substantial agreement is found except for the displacement between solute and cage center. The examined cage model, because of its simple structure, allows a straightforward analysis of the effects of the solvent cage and, in particular, of the distribution of cage frequencies describing the dispersion in the strength of solute–solvent interactions.},

In the absence of interaction the diffusion coefficient shows only a weak dependence on the polymer chain length and its behavior strongly resembles the usual site percolation. In the presence of interactions the diffusion coefficient (and especially its temperature dependence) shows a nontrivial behavior depending on the sign of interaction and on whether the voids and the hulls of the chains percolate or not. The temperature dependence may be Arrhenius-like or strongly non-Arrhenius, depending on parameters.

This leads to a better description of excitation energies and dissociation energies. The new zeroth-order Hamiltonian has been tested on CH2, SiH2, NH2, CH3, N2, NO, and O2, for which full configuration interaction (FCI) results are available. Further, excitation energies and dissociation energies for the N2 molecule have been compared to corresponding multireference (MR) CI results. Finally, the dissociation energies for a large number of benchmark molecules containing first-row atoms (the “G1” test) have been compared to experimental data. The computed excitation energies compare very well with the corresponding FCI and MRCI values. In most cases the errors are well below 1 kcal/mol. The dissociation energies, on the other hand, are in general improved in the new treatment but have a tendency to be overestimated when compared to other more accurate methods.},

This goal is achieved by combining the lattice-Boltzmann method with a discrete solution of the convection-diffusion equation for the different charged and neutral species that compose the fluid. The method is based on identifying the elementary fluxes between nodes, which ensures the absence of spurious fluxes in equilibrium. We show how the model is suitable to study electro-osmotic flows. As an illustration, we show that, by introducing appropriate dynamic rules in the presence of solid interfaces, we can compute the sedimentation velocity (and hence the sedimentation potential) of a charged sphere. Our approach does not assume linearization of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and allows us for a wide variation of the Peclet number. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {We have developed a self-consistent description of an interface between a metal and a molecular liquid by combination of the density functional theory in the Kohn–Sham formulation (KS DFT) for the electronic structure, and the three-dimensional generalization of the reference interaction site model (3D RISM) for the classical site distribution profiles of liquid. The electron and classical subsystems are coupled in the mean field approximation. The procedure takes account of many-body effects of dense fluid on the metal–liquid interactions by averaging the pseudopotentials of liquid molecules over the classical distributions of the liquid. The proposed approach is substantially less time-consuming as compared to a Car–Parrinello-type simulation since it replaces molecular dynamics with the integral equationtheory of molecular liquids. The calculation has been performed for pure water at normal conditions in contact with the (100) face cubic centered (fcc) surface of a metal roughly modeled after copper. The results are in good agreement with the Car–Parrinello simulation for the same metal model. The shift of the Fermi level due to the presence of water conforms with experiment. The electron distribution near an adsorbed water molecule is affected by dense water, and so the metal–water attraction follows the shapes of the metal effective electrostatic potential. For the metal model employed, it is strongest at the hollow site adsorption positions, and water molecules are adsorbed mainly at the hollow and bridge site positions rather than over metal atoms. Layering of water molecules near the metal surface is found. In the first hydration layer, adsorbed water molecules are oriented in parallel to the surface or tilted with hydrogens mainly outwards the metal. This orientation at the potential of zero charge agrees with experiment.},

The effects of sugars on the protein conformation are found to be relatively weak, in agreement with the preferential hydration of lysozyme. Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation times of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the fractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the slaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation times of lysozyme, sugars, and water molecules is observed within the studied concentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond network of sugar molecules. This percolation appears to be of primary importance to explain the influence of sugars on the dynamical properties of lysozyme and water.},

Thus the FM-AFM Ising model is adapted to produce precipitation of a sigma-type phase at high temperature, as observed in FeCr, in a form suitable for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the anomalous asymmetry observed in the miscibility gap of materials such as FeCr is also described, as is the finite low-temperature solubility and the onset of the stainless property for high-Cr content steel.},

	abstract = {We report periodic spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) predictions of hydrogen adsorption, absorption, dissolution, and diffusion energetics on and in ferromagnetic (FM) body-centered cubic (bcc) iron. We find that H prefers to stay on the Fe surface instead of subsurfaces or in bulk. Hydrogen dissolution in bulk Fe is predicted to be endothermic, with hydrogen occupying tetrahedral (t) sites over a wide range of concentrations. This is consistent with the known low solubility of H in pure Fe. In the initial absorption step, we predict that H occupies the deep subsurface t-site for Fe(110) and the shallow subsurface t-site for Fe(100). Diffusion of H into Fe subsurfaces is predicted to have a much lower barrier for Fe(100) than Fe(110). For H diffusion in bulk Fe, we find that H diffuses through bcc Fe not via a straight line trajectory, but rather hops from one t-site to a neighboring t-site by a curved path. Moreover, we exclude a previously suggested path via the octahedral site, due to its higher barrier and the rank of the saddle point. Quantum effects on H diffusion through bulk Fe are discussed.},

For Li+(aq), Ca2+(aq), Mg2+(aq), and Al3+(aq), our calculated IR frequency shifts, Δν(OH), with respect to the gas-phase water frequency, are about −300, −350, −450, and −750 cm−1, compared to −290, −290, −420, and −830 cm−1 from experimental infrared (IR) studies. The agreement is thus quite good, except for the order between Li+ and Ca2+. Given that the polarizing field from the Ca2+ ion ought to be larger than that from Li+(aq), our calculated result seems reasonable. Also the absolute OH frequencies agree well with experiment. The method we used is a sequential four-step procedure: QM(electronic) to make a force field+MD simulation+QM(electronic) for point-charge-embedded Mn+ (H2O)x��first shell (H2O)ysecond shell (H2O)zthird shell clusters+QM(vibrational) to yield the OH spectrum.

The phase diagram alters significantly, changing the materials properties already at sizes as large as 40 nm. A rationale is found in the surface strain that occurs between the different intercalated phases, which becomes energetically too costly in small particles. In particular the observed particle size-induced solid solution behavior is expected to have fundamental and practical implications for two-phase lithium or hydrogen insertion reactions.},

	abstract = {Water molecules confined to pores with sub-nanometre diameters form single-file hydrogen-bonded chains. In such nanoscale confinement, water has unusual physical properties that are exploited in biology and hold promise for a wide range of biomimetic and nanotechnological applications. The latter can be realized by carbon and boron nitride nanotubes which confine water in a relatively non-specific way and lend themselves to the study of intrinsic properties of single-file water. As a consequence of strong water–water hydrogen bonds, many characteristics of single-file water are conserved in biological and synthetic pores despite differences in their atomistic structures. Charge transport and orientational order in water chains depend sensitively on and are mainly determined by electrostatic effects. Thus, mimicking functions of biological pores with apolar pores and corresponding external fields gives insight into the structure–function relation of biological pores and allows the development of technical applications beyond the molecular devices found in living systems. In this Perspective, we revisit results for single-file water in apolar pores, and examine the similarities and the differences between these simple systems and water in more complex pores.},

	abstract = {We present a theoretical survey, based on reliable computer simulation methods, of defect energetics in TiO\$\_\{2-x\}\$. A lattice potential for TiO\$\_2\$ is developed and used in calculations of the formation energies of point and extended defects. We predict vacancies to be the most stable point defects. We show that they will exist in equilibrium with the shear planes that microscopy studies have detected in reduced rutile. We suggest that the stability of the extended defects is due predominantly to the occurrence of large stabilizing relaxations of the cations neighbouring the shear planes. The absence of appreciable binding for point defect clusters may also, however, be important. We show how both factors may be related to the exceptionally high static dielectric constant for the material.},
