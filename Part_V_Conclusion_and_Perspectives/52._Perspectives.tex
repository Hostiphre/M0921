\chapter{Perspectives\label{chpt:perspectives}}

Due to the difficulty of this thesis and my mental state, there are
a lot of un finished work and theory. Here lists some to give un idea.


\section{Reduce memory use in MDFT}

As shown in chapter III, memory leak can cause divergence and other
problem.


\subsection{Pass to simple precision}

L-BFGS-B is in double precision


\subsection{MPI of the L-BFGS-B minimizer}

As the code is a blackbox, in Fortran 77, it is difficult to parallelize
it. 


\section{Polarisable solute}

Vext variable


\section{MDFT Viewer}

This thesis contains a part of visualization

Viewer is an important part of code developing, which provide beautiful
visualization and easy analyzing helps to popularize the code. GaussViewer
is a good example.

The popular language of visualization is c++, OpenDM, ...


\section{Classical SCF method}

To be more compatible with Gaussian, {[}Jensen{]}

This is only an idea, the mathematical deduction is not fully verified.


\section{Other branches of development about MDFT}

3-body, polarization,
