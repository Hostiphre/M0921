\chapter{Model of Solution System\label{chpt:models}}

Computing models of solvents are broadly divided into two types: those
treating the solvent as a continuous medium (implicit models) and
those describing the individual solvent molecules (explicit models).
In the continuum model, the solvent is characterized by the dielectric
constant $\varepsilon$ and contains an artificially shaped cavity.
The explicit models can have more specific microscopic scales. Within
the scope of classical mechanics, the most detailed (and thus the most
expensive) methods involve flexible and polarizable explicit models,
while in computational chemistry, less detailed models often have
wider usage (for example, the proteins are treated in the unity of
residues). As the theory of liquids was initially established for spherical
atom-like solvent particles, the model adopted by such a theory is a
rigid entity carrying distributed point charges characterized by
their position and orientation, i. e. there is no internal movement
considered. This approximation has been proven reasonable \citep{Gray-Gubbins}.
There also exist models in which the scale lies somewhere between the implicit
and explicit models; for example, so-called coarse-grained models,
which gather groups of atoms into a single interaction
site.

In this section, we will give a brief introduction of the implicit
model in order to facilitate later discussion on solvation free energy
corrections. We will then focus on the rigid solvent models and discuss
the limits of such approximations. The flexible and polarizable models
will also be briefly mentioned. 

\section{Continuum solvation models}

Continuum models \citep{Jensen,Cramer_1999,Tomasi_1994_implicit_model},
which are popular in QM calculations, consider the solvent as a uniform
polarizable medium with dielectric constant $\varepsilon$\marginpar. The dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ is the key parameter characterizing
the solvent. It is normally a constant value, but that can depend on
the distance from the solute $M$. (see $\mathsection$\ref{subsec:Poisson=002013Boltzmann-methods})}, with the solute $M$ placed in the cavity within this medium (figure
\ref{fig:Reaction-field-model}) 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.72\columnwidth]{_figure/reaction-field-model_2}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Continuum solvent model\label{fig:Reaction-field-model}}
\end{figure}

The solvation Gibbs free energy according to this model is
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{solvation}}=\Delta G_{\mathrm{cavity}}+\Delta G_{\mathrm{dispersion}}+\Delta G_{\mathrm{elec}}\label{eq:cm}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G_{\mathrm{cavity}}>0$ is the energy needed to create
a hole in the medium, and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{dispersion}}$ is the
dispersion interaction, which is roughly the van der Waals energy
$\Delta G_{\mathrm{vdW}}<0$ between the solvent and solute. In principle,
there may also be a repulsive component, and the dispersion term is
sometimes denoted dispersion/repulsion. $\Delta G_{\mathrm{elec}}<0$
is the contribution of electrostatic interactions, introduced by electric
charge distribution of $M$ which polarizes the medium, and the action
back of the medium on the molecule (reaction field). 

The initial two terms in eq. (\ref{eq:cm}) are linked to the configuration
of the first solvation shell (cavity). The definition of cavity varies,
from the simplest sphere or ellipsoid to the ensemble of atomic surfaces
defined by the van der Waals radii in the solute. It is somewhat reasonable
to consider the cavity area as proportional to the number of solvent
molecules in the first solvation shell. This number can be calculated
as the area passing through the middle region of the first shell solvent.
This area, named the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) \citep{SAS_1,SAS_2},
can be calculated by adding the radius of the probe solvent ball on
the solvent excluded surface area (figure \ref{fig:sasa}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\columnwidth]{_figure/SASA}
\par\end{centering}
\caption[Definition of cavity surfaces]{Definition of cavity surfaces\label{fig:sasa}. The solvent accessible
surface (SAS) traced out by the center of the probe representing a
solvent molecule. The solvent excluded surface (SES) is the topological
boundary of the union of all possible probes that do not overlap with
the molecule.}
\end{figure}

The energy required to create such a cavity and the stabilization
due to van der Waals interactions between the solute and solvent,
assumed to be proportional to the surface area of the cavity, is expressed
as
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{cavity}}+\Delta G_{\mathrm{dispersion}}=\gamma S_{\mathrm{SASA}}+\beta
\end{equation}
or parameterized by having a constant $\xi$ specific for each atom
type, with the $\xi$ parameters being determined by fitting to experimental
solvation data:
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{cavity}}+\Delta G_{\mathrm{dispersion}}=\sum_{i}^{\mathrm{atoms}}\xi_{i}S_{i}
\end{equation}

The models and methods employed to calculate the electrostatic contribution
$\Delta G_{\mathrm{elec}}$ have varied greatly according to their
usage. The sections below list the most common examples. On another topic,
the integration of continuum models into \acs{QM} calculations is
also a very important field; these developments will not be detailed
here as they do not connect yet to our work. Such kinds of methods
are called the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) models, which
integrate the calculation of the solute-solvent interaction in addition
to that of the solute wave function by an iterative procedure. Some
examples are presented in the list of Gaussian keyword SCRF \citep{scrf},
and the field is well reviewed by, for example, Tomasi \citep{Tomasi_1994_implicit_model,tomasi_quantum_2005}
and Jensen \citep{Jensen}.

\subsection{Poisson-Boltzmann methods\label{subsec:Poisson=002013Boltzmann-methods}}

The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) \citep{holst_1994_poisson} makes
it possible to calculate the position-dependent electrostatic potential
$V_{\mathrm{elec}}(\mathbf{r})$ in the continuum model, such that
the electrostatic component of the free energy can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{elec}}=\frac{1}{2}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\rho_{q}(\mathbf{r})V_{\mathrm{elec}}(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{q}$ is the charge distribution \textcolor{red}{(of the
solute?)}.

The Maxwell-Gauss equation in SI units convention gives
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot D(\mathbf{r})=\dfrac{\rho_{q}(\mathbf{r})}{\varepsilon_{0}}
\end{equation}
where $D(\mathbf{r})=\varepsilon_{0}E(\mathbf{r})+P(\mathbf{r})$
is the electric displacement field, $P(\mathbf{r})$ is the system
polarization, $E(\mathbf{r})$ the electric field, and $\varepsilon_{0}$
the vacuum permittivity. $D(\mathbf{r})$ can also be expressed in
terms of the position-dependent dielectric constant $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r})$,
$D(\mathbf{r})=\varepsilon(\mathbf{r})E(\mathbf{r})$, which thus
gives
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\varepsilon(\mathbf{r})E(\mathbf{r})=\dfrac{\rho_{q}(\mathbf{r})}{\varepsilon_{0}}
\end{equation}
or in terms of electrostatic potential:
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf{r})\nabla V_{\mathrm{elec}}(\mathbf{r})\right]=-\dfrac{\rho_{q}(\mathbf{r})}{\varepsilon_{0}}\label{eq:poisson}
\end{equation}

This second-order differential equation (\ref{eq:poisson}) is called
the Poisson equation. 

This equation cannot be solved analytically for complex geometries
(such as a protein). Therefore it is done numerically using appropriate
methods; for example, the article of
Roux and Simonson \citep{roux_implicit_1999} or Holst \citep{holst_1994_poisson}.
A density functional approach based on the minimization of the polarization
density can also be used to solve this equation \citep{Marchi_2001,Levy_2005}.

If the solvent is ionic, the Poisson equation can be modified by taking
into account a (thermal) Boltzmann distribution of ions in the solvent,
i. e.,
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\mathrm{tot}}(\mathbf{r})=\rho_{q}(\mathbf{r})+qn_{\mathrm{ion}}\sinh(\frac{qe}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}V_{\mathrm{elec}}(\mathbf{r}))
\end{equation}

for a salt composed of ions of charge $+q$ and $-q$ and of density
$n_{\mathrm{ion}}$. Replacing in eq. (\ref{eq:poisson}) leads to
the Poisson-Boltzmann Equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot(\varepsilon(\mathbf{r})\nabla V_{\mathrm{elec}}(\mathbf{r}))-\dfrac{qn_{\mathrm{ion}}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\sinh\left(\dfrac{qV_{\mathrm{elec}}(\mathbf{r})}{kT}\right)=-\dfrac{\rho(\mathbf{r})}{\varepsilon_{0}}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Born / Onsager / Generalized Born models\label{subsec:Born-/-Onsager}}

For simple geometries, the Poisson equation (\ref{eq:poisson}) can
be solved analytically.

The simplest model is a spherical cavity. For a net charge $q$ in
a cavity of radius $a$, the electrostatic free energy of a medium
with a dielectric constant of $\varepsilon$ is given by the Born
formula:
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{elec}}(q)=-\dfrac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(1-\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\frac{q^{2}}{2a}
\end{equation}

Other similar models include the Onsager model, in which a point dipole
(characterized by the dipole moment $\mu$) is put in a spherical
cavity. The Kirkwood model refers to a general multipole expansion
in a spherical cavity, while the Kirkwood-Westheimer model arises
for an ellipsoidal cavity. Those simplified models are not fully able
to predict the solvent behavior in many realistic cases \citep{Jensen}. 

The generalized Born (GB) model is an empirical model based on the
superposition of several net charges in spherical cavities as the
Born model describes, with a similar formula:
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{elec}}=-\dfrac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(1-\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{f_{ij}}
\end{equation}
where the function $f_{ij}$ depends on the internuclear distance
$r_{ij}$ between the centers of atoms $i$ and $j$ and on the Born
radii for each pair of atoms $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$:
\begin{equation}
f_{ij}=\sqrt{r_{ij}^{2}-a_{i}a_{j}\exp\left(\frac{r_{ij}^{2}}{4a_{i}a_{j}}\right)}
\end{equation}

The key (empirical) point is to be able to attribute an effective
Born radius $a_{i}$ to each atom inside the complex, non-spherical
cavity formed by the solute. Once this is accomplished, the GB model provides
a very fast method, with an overall accuracy comparable to that of
Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. That makes it widely used in computational
structural biology to perform structure optimization and molecular
dynamics simulations.

\section{Model potential of explicit molecules}

The model potential frequently used in the theory of liquids is a
classical, rigid, pairwise additive model \citep{Hensen-McDonald,Gray-Gubbins}.
It is based on three assumptions. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Firstly, the quantum effects of <!-- Something missing here --> should be ignored. It is assumed that
the rotational and transitional motion of solvent particles are continuous
and classical, which means the separation of both transitional and
rotational states are largely inferior of $k_{\mathrm{B}}T$. For
light molecules, that is not always convincing. Some molecules containing
hydrogen (e. g. $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$, $\mathrm{NH_{3}}$, and particularly
$\mathrm{H_{2}}$) exhibit obvious quantum effects at low temperature
in the liquid state. Gaseous $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ and $\mathrm{NH_{3}}$
also need quantum effect corrections. However, for the liquid of most
interest to us, $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ at room temperature, the contribution
of this effect is small enough to be neglected. Obviously, there
should not be any chemical interaction of the solvent with the solute.
\item Secondly,\marginpar compared to atomic models that only depend on $\mathbf{r}^{N}$, the
angular correlations can give influence on both structural and thermodynamic
proprieties. That is why our theory is extended to linear case ($\mathbf{\Omega}\equiv(\Theta,\Phi)$)
then molecular case ($\mathbf{\Omega}\equiv(\Theta,\Phi,\Psi)$ ).} The intramolecular movement (vibration and internal rotation) should
be either independent of transitional and rotational movement or absent.
This rigid molecule approximation assumes that the intermolecular
potential $\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{r}^{N},\mathbf{\Omega}^{N})$ for $N$
particles only depends on the positions of the $N$ molecular centers
$\mathbf{r}^{N}\equiv(\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{r}_{N})$
and on their orientations $\mathbf{\Omega}^{N}\equiv(\mathbf{\Omega}_{1},\mathbf{\Omega}_{2},\cdots,\mathbf{\Omega}_{N})$,
where $\mathbf{\Omega}\equiv(\Theta,\Phi,\Psi)$ represents the Euler
angles (figure \ref{fig:Euler-angles}). The natural choice for the
molecular center is the center of mass. This is, however, arbitrary
if only equilibrium properties are considered.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{_figure/euler_sphere}
\par\end{centering}
\caption[Euler angles] The basis vectors of the new orientation are obtained
by 3 sequential operations: (1) A rotation $\phi$ $(0<\phi<2\pi)$
about the $z$-axis, bringing the frame of axes from the initial position
$\mathbf{S}$ into the position $\mathbf{S}'$ (2) A rotation $\theta$
$(0<\theta<\pi)$ about the $y$-axis of the frame $\mathbf{S}'$,
which is transformed into $\mathbf{S}''$ (3) A rotation $\psi$ $(0<\psi<2\pi)$
about the $z$-axis of the frame $\mathbf{S}''$.\label{fig:Euler-angles}}
\end{figure}

The rigid approximation is quite realistic for molecules in which
the separation of vibrational states largely exceeds $k_{\mathrm{B}}T$,
implying that the molecule stays in its ground vibrational state.
This is the case for many small solvent molecules such as $\mathrm{N_{2}}$,
$\mathrm{CO_{2}}$, $\mathrm{C_{6}H_{6}}$, and indeed for the bending
and stretching modes of water. 
\item Finally, the intermolecular forces have to be assumed as pairwise
additive:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{r}^{N},\mathbf{\Omega}^{N})=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\neq j}u(\mathbf{r}_{ij},\mathbf{\Omega_{i}},\mathbf{\Omega_{j}})=\sum_{i<j}u(\mathbf{r}_{ij},\mathbf{\Omega_{i}},\mathbf{\Omega_{j}})\label{eq:pair-potential}
\end{equation}
This means that the model potential only depends on the intermolecular
separation $\mathbf{r}$ and on the molecular orientations $\mathbf{\Omega}_{1}$
and $\mathbf{\Omega}_{2}$. This approximation is quasi-exact for
low density gases, where the contribution of the three and more body
terms decreases rapidly. But for dense fluids, in most of the cases
the multi-body potential cannot be ignored. The complete model potential
with higher-order corrections can be written in the form of
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{r}^{N},\mathbf{\Omega}^{N})=\sum_{i<j}u(ij)+\sum_{i<j<k}u(ijk)+\sum_{i<j<k<l}u(ijkl)+...
\end{equation}
where $u(ij)=u(\mathbf{r}_{ij},\mathbf{\Omega_{i}},\mathbf{\Omega_{j}})$
and $u(ijk)=u(\mathbf{r}_{ij},\mathbf{r}_{jk},\mathbf{r}_{ki},\mathbf{\Omega_{i}},\mathbf{\Omega_{j}},\mathbf{\Omega_{k}})$,
etc. The omission of the three-body and higher-order terms can cause errors in surface tension and surface energy calculation
\citep{Miyazaki_1975}. However the higher-order terms are often accounted
for by an effective pair potential (measured by experiments or calculated
by simulations), which reduces considerably the computational cost
for simulations, or the degree of theory needed. Such models are presented
below going from simple to molecular liquids. For the molecular solvent
considered in this thesis, water, most publications have stayed at
this two-body level of description. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interaction of spherical particle}

The simplest model of a fluid is the hard sphere model. With $d$
as the hard-sphere diameter, the pair potential is defined as:
\begin{equation}
u(r)=\begin{cases}
\infty & r<d\\
0 & r>d
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
This model is indeed a fundamental reference model in statistical
mechanics, and it can represent some physical systems such as neutral
colloidal suspensions. However, the absence of attractive force, which
precludes the existence of a liquid-gas transition, makes it too simple
for realistic fluids. More realistic neutral particle models, like
the Lenard-Jones (LJ) model, exhibit a potential energy curve that
has the same shape as the real interaction of rare gas, as shown in
figure \ref{fig:LJ-pair-potential}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.82]{_figure/lj-centre}
\par\end{centering}
\caption[LJ pair potential] The plot gives the potential energy $u(r)$ versus
internuclear distance $r$ of two particles. At large distances, both
attractive and repulsive interactions are small. As the distance between
the atoms decreases, the attractive electron-proton interactions dominate,
and the energy of the system decreases. At the observed bond distance,
the repulsive electron-electron and proton-proton interactions just
balance the attractive interactions, preventing a further decrease
in the internuclear distance. At very short internuclear distances,
the repulsive interactions dominate, making the system less stable
than the isolated atoms.\label{fig:LJ-pair-potential}}
\end{figure}

The Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction gives

\begin{equation}
u_{LJ}(r)=4\varepsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6}\right]
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the distance from centre to centre, $\sigma$ is the
collision diameter or the particles separation where $u(r)=0$, and
$\epsilon$ is the well depth of the potential (of unity energy $\mathrm{kJ/mol}$).
The well minimum occurs at $r_{\min}=2^{1/6}\sigma$ and $u(r_{\min})=-\epsilon$.
The parameters $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ can be extracted from experiments.

Theoretically, all terms in the multipole series represent attractive
contributions to the potential. The leading term, varying as $r^{-6}$,
describes the \textcolor{red}{(quantum?)} dipole-dipole interaction.
Higher-order terms represent dipole-quadrupole ($r^{-8}$), quadrupole-quadrupole
($r^{-10}$) interactions, and so on, but these are negligible compared
to $r^{-6}$. The short-range interaction is difficult to define properly,
and for the sake of simplicity and numerical efficiency, it is defined as $r^{-12}$
in the LJ model. 

If the spherical particles are charged (as in molten salts), the electrostatic
interaction between them is described by the Coulomb point charge
interaction:
\begin{equation}
u_{\mathrm{Coul}}(r)=\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r}
\end{equation}

For such charged simple fluids, the overall pair $u(r)$ is a sum
of LJ and Coulomb interactions. Such \textcolor{red}{decomposition}
can be extended to molecular fluids in terms site-site interactions,
which are discussed in the following section.

\subsection{Site-site interactions}

Indeed, a spherical description of interactions is not sufficient
to well describe molecular fluids. The site-site model is a further
extension of atomic models, in which the solvent molecule is represented
by a set of discrete interaction sites. The total potential energy
is a sum of spherical interaction potentials:
\begin{equation}
u(1,2)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha}\sum_{\beta}u_{\alpha\beta}(\left|\mathbf{r}_{2\beta}-\mathbf{r}_{1\alpha}\right|)
\end{equation}
\textcolor{red}{(the $1/2$ ?) }where $\mathbf{r}_{is}$ is the coordinates
of site $s$ in molecule $i$, $u_{\alpha\beta}(r)$ the interatomic
potential energy of pair of sites $\alpha$, $\beta$, as discussed
above. More specifically, it is generally decomposed into a Lennard-Jones
and a Coulombic contribution:
\begin{equation}
u(1,2)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha}\sum_{\beta}\left\{ 4\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}\left[\left(\frac{\sigma_{\alpha\beta}}{r_{12}^{\alpha\beta}}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma_{\alpha\beta}}{r_{12}^{\alpha\beta}}\right)^{6}\right]\:+\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{\alpha}q_{\beta}}{r_{12}^{\alpha\beta}}\right\} 
\end{equation}
where $r_{12}^{\alpha\beta}=\left|\mathbf{r}_{2\beta}-\mathbf{r}_{1\alpha}\right|$,
$\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}$ and $\sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ are the site-site
LJ parameters and $q_{\alpha}$the partial charge on each site. This
model is the most commonly adopted, and it will be so in this thesis.

\subsection{Multipole and spherical harmonic expansion}

To obtain less terms in the calculation, the model potential can be
presented in convergent series via multipole or spherical harmonic
expansion.

For polar liquids, the dipole-dipole interaction should be mainly
taken into account. Thus the model considers dipole-dipole interactions
in addition to a spherically symmetric Lennard-Jones-like potential:
\begin{equation}
u(1,2)=u_{0}(r)-\boldsymbol{\mu}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{r})\cdot\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector separation of the molecular centers,
$u_{0}(r)$ is the spherically symmetric term discussed above, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{i}$
is the dipole moment vector of particle $i$ and $\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{r})$
is the dipole-dipole interaction tensor:
\begin{equation}
T(\mathbf{r})=\nabla^{2}\left(\dfrac{1}{r}\right)=3\mathbf{r}\mathbf{r}/r^{5}-\mathbf{I}/r^{3}
\end{equation}
and $\mathbf{I}$ is the unit tensor. Note that this model can be
made more realistic by including higher-order electrostatic interactions,
such as dipole-quadrupole, quadrupole-quadrupole, etc. Such a systematic
multipolar approach has been proposed for water \citep{Chowdhuri_2006}.

Alternatively, the intermolecular potential can be expanded onto rotational
invariants in the form:
\begin{equation}
u(\mathbf{r}_{12},\mathbf{\Omega}_{1},\mathbf{\Omega}_{2})=\sum_{mnl\mu\nu}u_{\mu\nu}^{mnl}(r_{12})\Phi_{\mu\nu}^{mnl}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12},\mathbf{\Omega}_{1},\mathbf{\Omega}_{2})
\end{equation}
where the angular basis functions $\Phi_{\mu\nu}^{mnl}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12},\mathbf{\Omega}_{1},\mathbf{\Omega}_{2})$
can be expressed in terms of generalized spherical harmonics (\acs{GSH}s)
\citep{Gray-Gubbins}. A detailed description of rotational invariant
transform is in appendix \ref{chpt:rotational-invariant-expansion}.

\subsection{SPC/E water model}

As water cannot be perfectly described by a pair potential due to
multi-body effects, quantum effects, hydrogen bond, etc., various
models have been developed to fit a maximum number of properties.
Those models contain several sites, which can be placed possibly elsewhere
than at the center of atoms (figure \ref{fig:Water-models}). The
more sites the model has, the more precise it can be. There is a great
work done by Martin Chaplin \citep{water-model} to summarize the
most widely used water models.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{_figure/water}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Water models\label{fig:Water-models}}
\end{figure}

In this thesis, we use the extended simple point charge model (SPC/E)
of water \citep{SPC/E} as our solvent model though all this thesis.
\marginpar{It should be noted that any rigid solvent model is compatible with
the theory of liquids, e. g. acetonitrile used in \citep{Zhao_2011}.} It is a 3-site model, the electrostatic interaction being modeled
using Coulomb's Law and the dispersion and repulsion forces using
the Lennard-Jones potential, as described above.

With respect to the original SPC model, the SPC/E model adds an polarization
correction term to the SPC potential energy in order to better match
the experiment:

\[
E_{\mathrm{pol}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\dfrac{(\mu-\mu^{0})^{2}}{\alpha_{i}}
\]
where $\mu$ is the dipole of the effective pair model, $\mu^{0}$
is the dipole moment of an isolated water molecule, and $\alpha_{i}$
is the isotropic scalar polarizability \citep{SPC/E}. The SPC/E model
gives a better radial distribution function and diffusion constant
than the SPC model. It is the most commonly used model for applications.

Some parameters are listed in table \ref{tab:SPC/E}, compared with
its relative SPC model.

\subsection{Flexible and polarizable models}

Up to this point, molecules were considered as rigid bodies. Flexible
models give extra degrees of freedom in vibration and internal rotation.
In that case, the interaction potential contains several extra terms,
yielding typically five kinds of forces: three for the direct interactions,
in addition to the indirect interactions (LJ and Coulomb).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{_figure/flexible}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Interactions in a flexible model}
\end{figure}

The flexible yielding can deal with the non-rigidity of the solvent,
which is partially polarized owing to the vibrational degrees of freedom
(the so-called atomic polarizability). On the other hand, electronic
polarizability (the deformation of the molecule electron cloud under
the action of the external electric field) can be taken into account
even in a rigid model. This polarizability can be described by introducing
a modifiable charge distribution, for example by adding an induced
dipole at the molecular center of the molecule, or even on each of
its atomic site, and by solving the set of induced dipoles self-consistently.
Introducing variable atomic charges is possible too \textcolor{red}{{[}ref{]}}.
Optimizing the induced charges/dipoles has a large computational overhead
compared to fixed charges.

Complex models require expensive computing cost, but still can have
large fluctuations due to use of imposed small system size. There
is a compromise between the choice of model and the choice of system
size. For this reason, the rigid models are still nowadays the most
popular. On the other hand, computing technologies have largely developed
compared to the theories themselves, which makes it possible to use
more and more precise models in computation. 

\section{Model of solute}

The model of solute also have a substantial influence on the predicted
energy and structure of solvation. The solute can eventually be treated
by \acs{QM} calculations in terms of wave function and electron density.
This is the case for the implicit SCRF method, which for apolar solvents
(toluene, etc.) has been proven to work well. There is a clear mismatch
, however, between the very refined description of the solute and
the rather primitive continuous-medium treatment of the solvent. The
compromise to have a better model of solvent or solute is debatable,
and should vary according to the applications. On the other extreme,
for example, one never uses a quantum solvent model with an implicit
solute; this would not be profitable even if the solute is of simple
geometry (wall). In the case of molecular solutes, it is consistent
to require the solute and solvent to have at least the same scale
of description. Within molecular force fields, this leads to the hierarchy
of potential models described in figure (\ref{fig:Hierarchy-of-models}).
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{}%
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{_figure/solute}
\par\end{center}%
\end{minipage}\caption{Hierarchy of models\label{fig:Hierarchy-of-models}}
\end{figure}

In this thesis, we will use as a first step a rigid molecular model
to describe the solute. This is coherent with IET, which cannot treat
the solvent and solute at different scales of description. Polarizable
and/or flexible models of solute, and the coupling of a QM solute
to the molecular solvent will be described in perspective.

In a word of conclusion, the choice of model for the solute/solvent
system is a compromise between the required precision according to
the application, and the computing cost that the research can afford.
