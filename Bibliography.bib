@article{levesque_solvation_2012,
	Abstract = {We show that classical molecular density functional theory, here in the homogeneous reference fluid approximation in which the functional is inferred from the properties of the bulk solvent, is a powerful new tool to study, at a fully molecular level, the solvation of complex surfaces and interfaces by polar solvents. This implicit solvent method allows for the determination of structural, orientational, and energetic solvation properties that are on a par with all-atom molecular simulations performed for the same system, while reducing the computer time by two orders of magnitude. This is illustrated by the study of an atomistically-resolved clay surface composed of over a thousand atoms wetted by a molecular dipolar solvent. The high numerical efficiency of the method is exploited to carry a systematic analysis of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the surface-solvent interaction within the popular Clay Force Field (CLAYFF). Solvent energetics and structure are found to depend weakly upon the atomic charges distribution of the clay surface, even for a rather polar solvent. We conclude on the consequences of such findings for force-field development.},

@article{ramirez_direct_2005,
	Abstract = {To describe the solvation properties of polar or charged species, and the reaction free-energy of charge transfers, we propose a generalization of the Marcus electrostatic polarization free-energy functional which accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent. The proposed generic free energy functional relies crucially on the knowledge of the direct correlation function of the homogeneous solvent. For the case of a dipolar solvent, we show how this fundamental quantity can be extracted directly from molecular dynamics simulations of the pure solvent instead of the traditional route of integral equation theories. The direct correlation function computed from simulation is compared to approximate ones obtained from linearized and quadratic HNC integral closures. The performance of the corresponding density functionals is assessed, in comparison to "exact" molecular dynamics results, for the solvation free-energies and the solvent density profiles around simple molecular solutes.},

@article{zhao_accurate_2013,
	Abstract = {The direct correlation function (DCF) plays a pivotal role in addressing the thermodynamic properties with non-mean-field statistical theories of liquid state. This work provides an accurate yet efficient calculation procedure for evaluating the angular-dependent DCF of bulk SPC/E water. The DCF here represented in a discrete angles basis is computed with two typical steps: the first step involves solving the molecular Ornstein-Zernike equation with the input of total correlation function extracted from simulation; the resultant DCF is then polished in second step at small wavelength for all orientations in order to match correct thermodynamic properties. This function is also discussed in terms of its rotational invariant components. In particular, we show that the component c112(r) that accounts for dipolar symmetry reaches already its long-range asymptotic behavior at a short distance of 4 {\AA}. With the knowledge of DCF, the angular-dependent bridge function of bulk water is thereafter computed and discussed in comparison with referenced hard-sphere bridge functions. We conclude that, even though such hard-sphere bridge functions may be relevant to improve the calculation of Helmholtz free energies in integral equations or density functional theory, they are doomed to fail at a structural level.},

@article{jeanmairet_molecular_2015,
	Abstract = {The solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water is special because liquid and gas are almost at coexistence. In the common hypernetted chain approximation to integral equations, or equivalently in the homogenous reference fluid of molecular density functional theory, coexistence is not taken into account. Hydration structures and energies of nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes are thus incorrect. In this article, we propose a bridge functional that corrects this thermodynamic inconsistency by introducing a metastable gas phase for the homogeneous solvent. We show how this can be done by a third order expansion of the functional around the bulk liquid density that imposes the right pressure and the correct second order derivatives. Although this theory is not limited to water, we apply it to study hydrophobic solvation in water at room temperature and pressure and compare the results to all-atom simulations. The solvation free energy of small molecular solutes like n-alkanes and hard sphere solutes whose radii range from angstroms to nanometers is now in quantitative agreement with reference all atom simulations. The macroscopic liquid-gas surface tension predicted by the theory is comparable to experiments. This theory gives an alternative to the empirical hard sphere bridge correction used so far by several authors.},

	Abstract = {Molecular density functional theory (MDFT) offers an efficient implicit-solvent method to estimate molecule solvation free-energies, whereas conserving a fully molecular representation of the solvent. Even within a second-order approximation for the free-energy functional, the so-called homogeneous reference fluid approximation, we show that the hydration free-energies computed for a data set of 500 organic compounds are of similar quality as those obtained from molecular dynamics free-energy perturbation simulations, with a computer cost reduced by 2?3 orders of magnitude. This requires to introduce the proper partial volume correction to transform the results from the grand canonical to the isobaric-isotherm ensemble that is pertinent to experiments. We show that this correction can be extended to 3D-RISM calculations, giving a sound theoretical justification to empirical partial molar volume corrections that have been proposed recently.},

@article{borgis_molecular_2012,
	Abstract = {A molecular density functional theory of solvation is presented. The solvation properties of an arbitrary solute in a given solvent, both described by a molecular force field, can be obtained by minimization of a position- and orientation-dependent free-energy density functional. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the unknown excess term of the functional can be approximated by the angular-dependent direct correlation function of the pure solvent. This function can be extracted from a preliminary MD simulation of the pure solvent by computing the angular-dependent pair distribution function and solving subsequently the molecular Ornstein?Zernike equation. The corresponding functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional cubic grid for positions and a Gauss?Legendre angular grid for orientations to provide the solvation free energy of embedded molecules at the same time as the solvent three-dimensional microscopic structure. This functional minimization procedure is much more efficient than direct molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic integration schemes. The approach is shown to be also pertinent to the molecular-level determination of electron-transfer properties such as reaction free energy and reorganization energy. It is illustrated for molecular solvation and photochemical electron-transfer reactions in acetonitrile, a prototypical polar aprotic solvent.},

	Abstract = {In the density functional theory formulation of molecular solvents, the solvation free energy of a solute can be obtained directly by minimization of a functional, instead of the thermodynamic integration scheme necessary when using atomistic simulations. In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the expression of the free-energy functional relies on the direct correlation function of the pure solvent. To obtain that function as exactly as possible for a given atomistic solvent model, we propose the following approach: first to perform molecular simulations of the homogeneous solvent and compute the position and angle-dependent two-body distribution functions, and then to invert the Ornstein-Zernike relation using a finite rotational invariant basis set to get the corresponding direct correlation function. This rather natural scheme is proved, for the first time to our knowledge, to be valuable for a dipolar solvent involving long range interactions. The resulting solvent free-energy functional can then be minimized on a three-dimensional grid around a solute to get the solvent particle and polarization density profiles and solvation free energies. The viability of this approach is proven in a comparison with ``exact'' molecular dynamics calculations for the simple test case of spherical ions in a dipolar solvent.},

In the homogeneous reference fluid approximation, the expression of the free-energy functional relies on the knowledge of the direct correlation function of the pure solvent. After discussing general molecular solvents, we present a generic density functional describing a dipolar solvent and we show how it can be reduced to the conventional implicit solvent models when the solvent microscopic structure is neglected. With respect to those models, the functional includes additional effects such as the microscopic structure of the solvent, the dipolar saturation effect, and the nonlocal character of the dielectric constant. We also show how this functional can be minimized numerically on a three-dimensional grid around a solute of complex shape to provide, in a single shot, both the average solvent structure and the absolute solvation free energy.},

@article{roux_implicit_1999,
	Abstract = {Implicit solvent models for biomolecular simulations are reviewed and their underlying statistical mechanical basis is discussed. The fundamental quantity that implicit models seek to approximate is the solute potential of mean force, which determines the statistical weight of solute conformations, and which is obtained by averaging over the solvent degrees of freedom. It is possible to express the total free energy as the reversible work performed in two successive steps. First, the solute is inserted in the solvent with zero atomic partial charges; second, the atomic partial charges of the solute are switched from zero to their full values. Consequently, the total solvation free energy corresponds to a sum of non-polar and electrostatic contributions. These two contributions are often approximated by simple geometrical models (such as solvent exposed area models) and by macroscopic continuum electrostatics, respectively. One powerful route is to approximate the average solvent density distribution around the solute, i.e. the solute--solvent density correlation functions, as in statistical mechanical integral equations. Recent progress with semi-analytical approximations makes continuum electrostatics treatments very efficient. Still more efficient are fully empirical, knowledge-based models, whose relation to explicit solvent treatments is not fully resolved, however. Continuum models that treat both solute and solvent as dielectric continua are also discussed, and the relation between the solute fluctuations and its macroscopic dielectric constant(s) clarified.},

	Abstract = {The free energy difference between a model system and some reference system can easily be written as an ensemble average, but the conventional Monte Carlo methods of obtaining such averages are inadequate for the free-energy case. That is because the Boltzmann-weighted sampling distribution ordinarily used is extremely inefficient for the purpose. This paper describes the use of arbitrary sampling distributions chosen to facilitate such estimates. The methods have been tested successfully on the Lennard-Jones system over a wide range of temperature and density, including the gas-liquid coexistence region, and are found to be extremely powerful and economical.},

@article{Evans_1979,
	Abstract = { Abstract Recent theoretical work on the microscopic structure and surface tension of the liquid-vapour interface of simple (argon-like) fluids is critically reviewed. In particular, the form of pairwise intermolecular correlations in the liquid surface and the capillary wave treatment of the interface are examined in some detail. It is argued that conventional capillary wave theory, which leads to divergences in the width of the density profile, is unsatisfactory for describing all the equilibrium aspects of the interface. The density functional formalism which has been developed to study the liquid-vapour interface can also be profitably applied to other problems in the statistical mechanics of non-uniform fluids; here a new generalization of the `linear' theory of spinodal decomposition is formulated and by considering a `nearly uniform' fluid, some useful results for the long-wavelength behaviour of the liquid structure factor of various monatomic liquids are obtained. Some other topics of current interest in this area are briefly discussed. },

@incollection{Hunenberger_book,
	Abstract = {The experimental determination of single-ion solvation free energies{,} as well as of corresponding derivative thermodynamic solvation parameters{,} is complicated by two fundamental problems: (i) the local electroneutrality of macroscopic matter at equilibrium and its corollary{,} the absence of free gas-phase ions in equilibrium situations; (ii) the presence of a surface polarization at air-liquid interfaces. Chapter 2 discusses these two problems in sequence{,} and provides a summary of their practical implications. The local electroneutrality constraint implies that single-ion solvation parameters are only directly accessible{,} via calorimetry and gas-phase spectroscopy-based statistical mechanics{,} in the form of sums over neutral ion combinations or{,} equivalently{,} as conventional (relative) values{,} i.e. with the proton parameters set to zero by definition. Absolute single-ion solvation parameters can also be obtained via Voltaic cell experiments and workfunction measurements. However{,} the presence of surface polarization effects at air-liquid interfaces implies that these determinations lead to real values{,} i.e. including the reversible work of interface crossing. The absolute single-ion solvation parameters that are of greatest theoretical relevance are intrinsic{,} i.e. solely characterizing the interaction of the ion with its polarized solvent environment{,} without contamination from surface effects. They cannot be accessed on the sole basis of experimental data and require the introduction of some apparently reasonable but formally unprovable postulate or model{,} called in this context an extra-thermodynamic assumption. The introduction of a specific assumption permits to anchor the conventional scale by providing estimates for either of three equivalent experimentally-elusive solvent-dependent quantities{,} namely the intrinsic solvation free energy GH{,}svt of the proton{,} the intrinsic absolute potential VH{,}svt of the reference hydrogen electrode{,} or the air-liquid interfacial potential [small chi]svt{,} along with their pressure or/and temperature derivatives. Unfortunately{,} considering the case of water{,} the use of different experimental approaches along with distinct extra-thermodynamic assumptions leads to a very large uncertainty range on the order of 0.5-1.0 V (potentials) or 50-100 kJ[middle dot]mol-1 (free energy) in the estimated values for the three above quantities.},

They can be used to evaluate approximate theories of liquids, and to provide detailed information on the structure and dynamics of model liquids at the molecular level. This book is an introduction and practical guide to the molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods.    The first four chapters describe these methods in detail, and provide the essential background in intermolecular forces and statistical mechanics.  Chapters 5 and 6 emphasize the practical aspects of writing efficient programs and analysing the simulation results.  The remaining chapters cover advanced techniques, non-equilibrium methods, Brownian dynamics, quantum simulations, and some important applications.  FORTRAN code is presented in the text.}},
