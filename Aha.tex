\ctparttext{\textcolor{red}{(Chapter introduction is to clear the motivation
and relation between sections.)}\\
\medskip{}
This chapter is summery of all the previous work that this thesis
is based on.\\
\medskip{}
In section \ref{chpt:models}, we begin by introducing the models
used in our study, as well as some other models in different scale
of description, to make our choice of model reasonable. \\
\medskip{}
Once the model is chosen, all the theories become mathematical problems.
Section \ref{chpt:statistical-mechanics} reviews some basic concepts
of statistical mechanics for liquid (liquid theory), which present
the deduction of formalisms from the model of the system, without
introducing any artificial term. The following two sections, section
\ref{chpt:iem} and \ref{chpt:mdft} give two frontier domains of
the liquid theory: the integral equation theory (\acs{IET}), and
the molecular density functional theory (\acs{MDFT}) that this thesis
works on. The mathematical equivalence between these two theories
is therefore clear, presented in section \ref{chpt:mdft}, which gives
us the idea to use the expansion technics in \acs{IET} to serve \acs{MDFT}.\\
\medskip{}
After all, a brief introduction of the simulations depending on micro
configuration, here referring to molecular dynamics (\acs{MD}) and
Monte Carlo (\acs{MC}) method, is made in section \ref{chpt:reference-method},
to the purpose to explain how the direct correlation functions (\acs{DCF})
used by this thesis are obtained.}
