\ctparttext{\textcolor{red}{(Chapter introduction is to clear the motivation
and relation between sections.)}\\
\medskip{}
This chapter is a summary of all the previous work that this thesis
is based on.\\
\medskip{}
In section \ref{chpt:models}, we begin by introducing the models
used in our study, as well as some others of different scale
or description by way of comparison to illustrate why we chose our models. \\
\medskip{}
Once the model is chosen, all the theories become mathematical problems.
Section \ref{chpt:statistical-mechanics} reviews some basic concepts
of statistical mechanics for liquids (liquid theory), which present
the deduction of formalisms from the model of the system, without
introducing any artificial terms. The following two sections, section
\ref{chpt:iem} and \ref{chpt:mdft} give two frontier domains of
the liquid theory: the integral equation theory (\acs{IET}), and
the molecular density functional theory (\acs{MDFT}) that this thesis
works upon. The clear mathematical equivalence between these two theories
is presented in section \ref{chpt:mdft}, which gave
us the idea to use the expansion techniques in \acs{IET} to serve \acs{MDFT}.\\
\medskip{}
Finally, a brief introduction of the simulations we used is made in section \ref{chpt:reference-method}. Depending on micro
configuration, this includes molecular dynamics (\acs{MD}) and
Monte Carlo (\acs{MC}) simulation methods.
This is done to explain how the direct correlation functions (\acs{DCF})
portrayted in this thesis are obtained.}
