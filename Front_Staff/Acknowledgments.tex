\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would love to express my most respectful gratitude to my thesis
advisors, Daniel Borgis and Luc Belloni, who developed the main theory
used in this thesis and whose great knowledge of liquid theory, not to mention the genius way of thinking and explaining have given me a
solid guide on doing this research. I would also like to take this time to thank them
for their tireless work in correcting this manuscript.

I'm grateful to Maximilien Levesque, who also belongs to this
project and joined the supervision of my thesis. Thanks for sharing
some results and data that has been useful to my work.

I wish to acknowledge all the great minds willing to evaluate
and give ideas about my work: \textcolor{red}{(noms des jur√©s)}, thank
you for agreeing to be part of the jury of this thesis.

As a Masters student issue with a pure chemistry speciality, a lack
of knowledge about Informatics brought me a lot of difficulties. I
would like to express my sincere gratitude to my colleagues Pierre
Kestener, Matthieu Haefele, Yacine Ould-Rouis, and Martial Mancip
for their huge aid and very useful advice in the area of Informatics.

This thesis was produced at \textit{Maison de la Simulation, CEA Saclay},
financially supported by Bourse Idex-CEA. I appreciate all the
organizations and staff that gave me the chance to have this three-year
experience.

I am also grateful to ... for the help given in correcting the huge amount of
grammar faults in this manuscript.

I'm deeply indebted to my tutors of license and master, Monsieur Hongwei
Tan and Madame Michelle Gupta, whose clear logic and warm encouragement
gave me all that I need to be in love with theoretical chemistry.

Finally I would like to thank my father, who made the right decision
to send me here to France and support me in every aspect.
