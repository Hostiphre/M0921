When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself
 only, what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out.

 Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe, or by
 what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed.

 But look only, and solely, at what are the facts.

 me a solid guide for doing this research.
 I would also like to thank them for their tireless work in correcting this
 manuscript.

As a master student issue from pure chemistry speciality, a lack of knowledge
 about Informatics brought to me a lot of difficulties.

 Matthieu Haefele, and Yacine Ould-Rouis for their huge aid in Informatics
 and very useful advices during this thesis.
